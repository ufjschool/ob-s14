 [TITLE] Title suggestion: Learn More about Sex Beyond the Abstinence-Only Education 

Here's a fun fact: Florida state law does not require sexual health education to be medically accurate. (1) 

That is not to say that everything you know about sex is wrong, but if you attended public school in Florida or in any of the other 36 states that care more about age appropriateness (2) than facts, there might be a few gaps in your knowledge. 

The scare tactics favored by many public school health programs, also known as the “don’t have sex or you’ll get pregnant and die” approach, have their roots in the Reagan era. The Reagan administration began putting all their money and support behind abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. 

“I remembered in high school going to our sexual health fairs, which were basically like ‘Ripley’s Believe It or Not,’ with every up-close picture of an STI you could imagine. And no really, real information,” said Kylie Brianne, president of University of Florida’s Voices for Planned Parenthood. 

“The idea that that stuff they were telling me might have been wrong, and that might have been perfectly legal and okay, was super scary to me,” she said. 


Since then, much research has been done to prove that abstinence-only programs don’t work, but most states have yet to get the memo. 

In the eight-point definition of abstinence education (3) developed by the federal government, one of the required elements of an abstinence education program was “sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects.” 

According to Samantha Evans, sexual health educator at GatorWell Health Promotion Services, healthy sexual activity can have positive effects on the body and mind. 

Among these are: (4)
• Increased libido – “The more frequently you have sex, the better sex feels,” Evans said. This increase in libido is especially helpful for women who are on hormonal contraception or who are in transition to menopause. 
• Calorie burning – “It’s not going to replace lifting weights or going to a yoga class, but there are studies that say you can burn five calories a minute,” Evans said.
• Increased heart function and possibly the function of specific muscles depending on the vigor of the sex act, positions used, and other factors
• Lowered blood pressure 
• Lowered risk of heart attack and prostate cancer
• Balanced hormone levels
• Increased immune system function
• Lowered stress and improved sleep

Abstinence-only education does not arm adolescents with the knowledge to prevent risks increased with sexual activity. Some research has shown that abstinence-only strategies might even be deterring contraceptive use among sexually active teens. (5) Risks include sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infections and pregnancy. 

Focus on STIs was reduced from time spent discussing contraceptive options and other aspects of sex such as hygiene, consent, sexuality and the basics of biology and anatomy. Comprehensive sex education programs could go a long way towards filling these gaps.

“The baseline of the comprehensive approach [to sex education] is that knowledge is power,” said Evans.

The problem is that peers and unreliable sources on the Internet spread misinformation.  

Common myths Evans has frequently encountered in students include the idea that using more than one condom at a time increases protection and that the hymen always tears the first time someone has sex. Using two condoms at once makes it more likely that the condoms will break. And the hymen does not need to tear – just stretch. Sufficient preparation, patience and a little bit of lube can easily prevent pain and tearing, no matter how inexperienced an individual may be. 

During her time with Voices for Parental Parenthood, Brianne has had similar experiences with undereducated students. 

It’s primary forms of outreach are setting up tables with information and Condom Crawls, during which its members make small bags of condoms, lube and candy to hand out around midtown and downtown Gainesville on Friday nights. They also give out condoms at events on campus. On Valentine’s Day, they distributed almost 1,500 condoms. 

Events give the opportunity for members to speak with students. Their tables are decorated with two realistic dildos and a vulva model, used to demonstrate the correct way to use condoms and some of the basics of anatomy.

“We get people at the tables who are like, ‘I’ve seen some scary pictures of STIs and that’s all I know,’” Brianne said.

VOX gives anyone who is interested in listening a crash course in anatomy and safe sex, but even the students’ knowledge is limited. 

“The two things that we have the hardest time pushing at our tables are the internal condoms and lube,” Brianne said.

Many people have never heard of an internal condom, which is a condom that is inserted into the vagina or anus prior to sex. It looks a little like a trash bag, Brianne admitted. But the FC2s, the brand favored by VOX, come with many benefits. They are non-latex, a little softer than a traditional condom and have heat transfer. They can be inserted a few hours before sexual activity. 

Lube gets recognized more often, but it comes with its own set of stereotypes.

“We hear a lot of, ‘I don’t do butt stuff; why would I need that?’” Brianne said. 

A common misconception about lube is that it is only for anal sex, but in reality, lube is also a pretty important bedroom accessory for vaginal sex, at least for individuals whose bodies don’t produce much natural lubrication. 

The consequences of widespread ignorance regarding sexual health extend far beyond the physical effects. Ignorance breeds fear and shame. People need the facts to understand their bodies, and they need sources of support and affirmation. 

“A mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage” is not, as the government states, “the expected standard of sexual activity.” (3) 

“Don’t feel shame about anything that’s happening to your body as a result of your sexual activity,” said Brianne. “I think that’s something that gets beaten into us as young adolescents, is that anything that happens as a result of our sexual desires is dirty and wrong, and that leads to people not seeking medical treatment when they have an issue.”

All of this is not meant to suggest that having sex is the only way to be empowered. Empowerment is about the ability to make the choice that is right for you. It’s the ability to say either “yes” or “no” because you want to, because it’s best for you, and not because you think you should or you’re afraid of what someone else will think.

Be promiscuous; be celibate; be something in between. Know your resources. Know your body. Don’t be afraid to talk about it.
