Ghost stories are strange animals. Year after year you hear them in different voices, see them through different lenses. You can’t prove they exist but can never seem to put a figure on why they don’t. 
 
Tracing its roots back before the Civil War, the University of Florida has quite a past. This university has seen world wars and world peace, segregation and integration. It’s seen national championships. And like anything of a great age, this university has seen death. Lots of death.
 
With death and history comes the inevitable – the ghost story. 

BEATY 

“The lights were all off”
 
It happened in Beaty Towers East, the third floor. Ben Dostovic was in his room trying to get to sleep, said then-sophomore Arianne Romero, 21, a friend of his. As he lay in bed he began to hear a familiar sound: the rolling chairs moving around in the kitchen area.
 
“He ignored it at first and tried going back to sleep,” Romero said, her voice filled with the thrill of telling a scary story.
 
Then, he heard something bang loudly against his door. Annoyed, he got out of bed and barged into the kitchen area, thinking it was his roommates messing around.
 
No one was in the room, and the lights were all off.
 
Dostovic checked the bathroom to make sure his roommates hadn’t ducked in there to hide. Nothing. Figuring they’d run back into their own rooms, he flung open their door.
 
Only one roommate was home, and he was sound asleep. When Dostovic woke him up, he had no idea what was going on.
 
And that was only the first time, Romero said. Another night, Dostovic was trying to fall asleep when he heard the sound again – chairs moving in the common room. No one was home.
 
He ignored it until he saw his doorknob turn, slowly.
 
“He didn’t go to sleep that night,” Romero said.
 
A little history

Jutting ungracefully out of the corner of 13th Street and Museum Road, Beaty Towers is a campus landmark and, to some, and eyesore. The coed dorm was somewhat eerily known as the “Twin Towers” when it opened in 1967, but was eventually named after professor Robert Calder Beaty (http://www.uff.ufl.edu/Facilities/Facilities.asp?ID=104). Beaty was a WWI veteran and former University of Florida Dean of Student Personnel who retired in 1960.
 
The UF housing history book (http://www.housing.ufl.edu/media/about/aboutus.historybookpdf.pdf ) calls Beaty Towers an “architectural anomaly” on campus, because high-rise residential facilities were nonexistent at UF and scare throughout the southeast in general. Each of the 200 apartments in Beaty typically house four students, with two bedrooms, one bathroom and a common living area and kitchenette. 
 
The dorm opened in the midst of social change on college campuses, the book explains. 1967 said goodbye to dress codes and curfews for female students, and by the following summer, UF residential hall associations were no longer divided by gender.
 
Supposedly around that time, a girl jumped from her Beaty dormitory to her death.
 
A suicide legend
 
Kids have died on the UF campus. Death is an inevitability among 50,000 students. Some of them have died in their dorm rooms, some in Beaty Towers. A simple Google search of “UF student died Beaty Towers” turns up old Gainesville Sun articles with details. One of the first to come up is a November 1987 write-up of the alcohol poisoning death of 18-year-old freshman Robert Stevenson, who was found in his dorm room at Beaty Towers East (http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19871126&id=Hj9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D-oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3704,3048058).
 
Deaths like his are the ones few remember, the ones nobody talks about. For whatever reason, it is a death that nobody can prove actually happened that UF students hear about over and over.
 
From what I gather, it’s Gator household story that a female student committed suicide by jumping from her Beaty dormitory. Which tower was it? Which room did she jump from? What year did it happen? Nobody seems to be able to answer these questions, though they keep coming up. I even remember hearing the girl was pregnant when she jumped.
 
According to the people who should know, however, there is no record of a girl killing herself by jumping from Beaty. I contacted the one man who might know if anyone does: UF historian and curator Carl Van Ness.
 
An “American Girl”?
 
The suicide legend stems from the Tom Petty song “American Girl,” Van Ness said. A popular interpretation of the song is a girl contemplating suicide. The connection to the University of Florida and, specifically, Beaty Towers, comes from the second stanza:
 
Well, it was kind of cold that night,
She stood alone on her balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,
Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach.
And for one desperate moment
There he crept back in her memory
God, it’s so painful when something that’s so close
Is still so far out of reach.
 
U.S. Highway 441 is actually 13th Street in Gainesville, which runs right past Beaty Towers.
 
Tom Petty is a Gainesville native and would have seen the dorm many times.
 
“Speculation has always focused on Beaty Towers as it was the only building tall enough at the time,” Van Ness said.
 
However, he said he has never seen any records to indicate the song is based on an actual event. Also, anyone can look up at Beaty Towers and see that no balconies exist.
 
“How a ghost appears is another question,” he said. “Apparently, it is the ghost of someone who never existed.”
 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando echoes Van Ness in his claim that nobody has committed suicide by jumping from Beaty Towers, according to an August 2009 article from The Independent Florida Alligator (http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_28668d1f-4473-57b1-9d52-ddce62158263.html). Orlando said he has met Tom Petty in person and that the singer said the rumors were completely false.
 
Despite these repeated denials, the Tom-Petty-Beaty-Towers-suicide legend stubbornly lives on. Even the Wikipedia page for “American Girl” has a section devoted to the rumor. Whenever I hear that Tom Petty song, the looming shape of Beaty inevitably comes to mind.
