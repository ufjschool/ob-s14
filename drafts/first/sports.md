 
##ENERGY OF AN ATHLETE / ENERGY BEHIND THE PERFORMANCE

##INTRO

For some UF athletes, energy is the electric buzz of techno music. For others, it’s the feeling of caffeine coursing through their veins. Energy is a green Gatorade bottle or a chocolate-peanut butter Clif bar; it’s feeling cold water sliding down your throat during an afternoon practice or the smell of a sizzling steak at dinnertime. Energy is that moment of complete mental and physical suspension before the gun goes off, a whistle sounds, or the ball is snapped – it’s a team prayer, the words of a coach, the hopeful cries of fans. For athletes at UF, just the mere sight of an orange and blue jersey is enough to power them up, inject their spirits, and send them flying full-force into a performance of their lifetime. 

Talent takes an athlete only so far. Behind the record-setting times, the slam-dunks, the point-scoring plays and the perfect 10.0’s, lies months of preparation with an entire team of coaches who stand ready to infuse energy into both the body and mind of an athlete. Like an actor on stage, the individual athlete collaborates with an entire team of backstage managers in order to give their best possible performance on game-day.

##WOMEN'S TRACK

Looking at the European snow-capped mountains for the last time, Agata Strausa knew she was going to need much more than coffee and her favorite dark chocolate to get her through this trip. Two years ago, Strausa, now 24, chose to leave behind her Latvian family and her career in industrial Design at the Berlin Academy of Arts to pursue her dream to become a professional distance-runner.

Trying to relax on the ten-hour flight to Gainesville, she closed her eyes and counted days: One day until she’d be in another country. Ten days until she’d walk into her first UF art history class. And 30 until she’d lace up her spikes, slip on her orange and blue jersey and compete for the first time as a UF mid-distance track runner. 

“Energy is more in the mind than in the body,” she said. “It’s not so much about how you fuel yourself and your body but more like how your attitude is.”

Strausa was pretty much born motivated. Determined to balance both athletics and academics, she spent nearly two hours a day commuting from Berlin’s Academy of Arts to the other side of the city for her team practices. Pulling all-nighters and having to squeeze in extra studio hours at her college, she was ready for a change and transferred to UF for her final two years of undergraduate study. 

“My roommates, who were also my teammates, made it really easy for me,” she said. “They were my energy.”

Callie Cooper, 23, a four-year UF distance runner and 2013 graduate, was a guide and mentor for Strausa. As an organic-crop production major and former vegan, Cooper had fully embraced Gainesville’s agricultural corners. Trader Joe’s excursions, Wednesday Farmer’s Market runs, and organic pre-run breakfasts had quickly become the heart of “The Coop,” the name of Cooper and Strausa’s four bedroom Gainesville home whom they shared with two other girls. 

“My goal is just to live healthy,” Cooper said, who now resides in Eugene, Oregon and runs for Team Eugene running club. “That’s why I love running so much. It keeps you fit and healthy.”

While Strausa focuses on fueling her body with lean protein sources and vegetables, she stays sure to indulge once in a while on Ritter Sport dark chocolate and religiously drinks a double-shot Starbucks espresso before every race. <<Somewhat out of place 

But the excitement of living in this Florida farm town, studying at a new school and competing on a team five times the size of the one in Germany didn’t even compare to how she felt before her first indoor race. Only a month after moving in, Strausa debuted in the 3,000-meter race at the indoor University of Washington Husky Classic in Seattle. Stepping onto the track with some of the top collegiate distance runners in the country and professionals representing companies such as Nike and Adidas left her completely speechless.

“I didn’t even know what to say,” she said. “I just remember I was so pumped and excited and energized the first time I put the Florida jersey on to compete. That was a special moment for me.” 

Staying focused on the race and getting to the starting line on time, Strausa remembers stepping out of her warm-up clothes a little too early. UF head track and field coach, Mike Holloway, was by her side with compassion, advice, and some pre-race encouragement. 

 “It meant that my head coach really cares about me and has like his eyes on us all of the time,” she said. “He takes his job really seriously and takes what we do really seriously.” 

With her coaches and teammates cheering on the sidelines, she let the orange and blue energy cruise her to the finish line, running a personal best of  9:17.

After that, she knew UF was going to be good. 

Fast-forward two years, and her energy is far from depleted. Having worked under a team of coaches, athletic trainers, nutritionists, and 15 other distance runner teammates, this All-American feels more charged than ever.

“Every athlete is just as good as his support system,” she said. “Its not just about the athlete’s performance, its about how the people that perform that stand behind the athlete.” 

Andy Klock, head UF track and field athletic trainer, is one big part of Strausa’s success. Spending up to 70 hours a week with the team in season, Klock enjoys helping the athletes reach their potential not just in their sport, but in life.

“We constantly try to maintain a very positive atmosphere in the athletic training room,” he said. “One technique I utilize as well is reminding the athlete that the only person they are competing with is themselves.”

Much of Strausa’s schedule revolves around working with her trainers in injury prevention, a nutritionist in creating meal plans, and a weight coach in strength training. But at the end of the day, it always comes back to her teammates and other athletes. 

“Just the encouragement from your teammates means a lot cause they are going through kind of the same things and we have a similar lifestyle,” she said.  “Other athletes give me a lot of energy too.”

Strausa especially looks to 5K American record-holder Bernard Lagat for inspiration. 
“His interviews are just so motivational and energizing because he’s always so positive about everything, and that gives me a lot of energy,” she said.

##MEN'S BASKETBALL 

When the Gators took on the Kentucky Wildcats at Rupp, ESPN displayed before and after pictures of UF seniors Will Yeguete, Casey Prather and Patric Young. Each looked more pumped up than the next, with muscles so defined, you'd think that Michelangelo sculpted them himself. Once lanky, now some of the strongest guys in the nation for men’s basketball. All are a product of Preston Greene’s training programs. 

Greene, AGE, has been the team’s strength and conditioning coordinator for three seasons. Every day, year round, he’s with the team making them stronger, more flexible and faster than the day they were recruited.  

He’s the guy on the court before the game stretching the guys out that all the girls wish they could be. Of all the components, that make up a UF men’s basketball player, Greene is, literally, the most hands on. 

This relationship begins when incoming freshmen enroll for Summer B. Throughout voluntary off-season training sessions, Greene begins to evaluate each player and creates a personal program for each player to fix what he calls their “weak link.” The way each player runs, how they condition, how they move on the court and what position they play are all taken into consideration. With each season, the training program is altered as the players grow and improve. After the season is over, Greene meets with Head Coach Billy Donovan and the coaching staff to set goals for each player. Optimal body weights are their focus. 
“I want my guys to be very,very lean,” Greene stressed, “because the leaner or less body fat they have, for basketball, the quicker they are and the higher they can jump. If a guy has, in my opinion, a higher body fat than I would like, then I will determine his body weight off of that. Or if a guy is already lean and he’s at the weight that I want." 

EXAMPLE WITH WILL 

Greene compares the process to that of getting your car aligned. Just as you let go of your steering wheel to see what direction your car goes in, basketball players are the same way in the way they move on the court and in the weight room. 

"Guys may be quicker to their right then they are to their left," Greene explained. "They may be tighter in one muscle than another one that works synergistically with each other. They may be stronger in one part of the body versus another part of the body. Those ratios change throughout the season just because of the way they move, the way they play, injuries." 

After a head-to-toe breakdown on each guy of their tightest and weakest spots, Greene prescribes certain exercises, movements, sets and reps to align each player's steering wheel. 

Throughout year, Greene's role changes. After assessments in the pre-season, Greene said, “I am just smashing these guys physically and mentally each and every day without basically a whole lot of basketball involved." He meets with them in training groups made up of six groups of two players based on the goals of the players. During the season, once the basketball is in their hands again, Greene has to ease up, and training groups consolidate to three or four guys in a group. 

“Priority at that time is winning games, practicing and being ultra competitive on the court," Greene ----, "so I can’t do a whole lot with them during that time frame. If I am smashing them and killing those guys, then Coach Donovan is going to be pretty upset at me because we aren’t going to be our best come game time.” 

With the Gators undefeated for SEC conference games, Greene is ecstatic. His positive energy is a staple for the team, though -- win or lose. 

“One way I’ve been successful is I’m very, very energetic and very passionate about what we do," he ---, "so when my guys come in to train, they tend to feed off my energy. When they come in, I’m ready to go right off the bat.”


“They know from day one that there is a certain level of expectation that needs to be met on the court and in the weight room.” 

WILL QUOTE 


“I’m pretty fortunate to work for a very, very successful head coach. Coach Donovan can be pretty selective in who he recruits, so I am very fortunate where I have a really, really good group of guys who want to all win and want to accomplish their individual goals and our team goals and they all want to play professionally at some level, so right there off the bat, there is an internal motivation that these guys have, so that helps me.” 


“I have the support from Coach Donovan. He tells these guys during the recruiting process and during their time here, we are going to work in this program. You’re not just going to show up and play games. You are going to practice every day. You are going to condition. You are going to lift weights. You are going to do all these things in order to be successful, and that’s kind of the values of our program. Our program is based on hard work. They get this message from everybody.” 

Having been successful here, there is a level of expectation that this program is based off of national championships, Final Four appearances, and success of former Gator athletes in NBA. 

"They see these guys come back and work and that really hits home with our young guys. It’s like, ‘Hey! OK, these guys are not just talented. They work to be successful.’” 

When they walk through the doors, he’s going to get it out of them no matter what is happening outside. 
	“You’re not leaving until we accomplish what I need to accomplish." 

##MEN'S SWIMMING

It’s 5:30 am when the bright lights of the O’Connell Center Indoor Pool switch on and the 50 members of the swim team trickle in. Tommy Stitch, head athletic trainer for the team, spends his time filling orange Gatorade tubs, treating flu-season colds, and waits for the sun to rise and a new day to begin.

“There is no typical day for me,” Stitch said. 

After a two-hour practice, he heads right over to the weight room where the team holds an hour strength and conditioning session. His day follows up with an afternoon practice, post-practice treatments and rehab, not to mention appointment scheduling, paperwork and staff meetings. Throw away-meets into the mix and you have a near 24/7 job.

“Its so easy to take care of people at UF. We have so many resources,” he said. “And if you can’t figure something out, there’s always a bunch of other people that can. We’re all working together.”

Studying exercise science at Fresno State and LSU, Stitch has worked with volleyball, lacrosse and tennis. It wasn’t until he ventured to the Swamp where he found his true training rhythm in swimming.

“Swimmers are disciplined,” he said. “It’s humbling to be around people that are so focused on what they do everyday – it makes you better.”

Competing most years from September through April, swimming at UF is considered a year-long sport. With the constant get-up-and-go energy among swimming phenomena, Stitch pays special attention to maintaining each individual athlete’s energy.

“There are some days where they all just looked drained,” Stitch said. “We just communicate: Every day, all day, communicating about everybody. I think a lot of people kind of feed off that.”

Matt Thompson, 21, IM and freestyle and sports management junior, sure does.

“With the training program, you can overwork things. If you’re not feeling well and you’re having a bad practice and you just don’t speak up about it, it can look like you’re just not trying,” he said. “Communication is definitely the biggest thing.”

For Thompson, its crucial for athletes to be proactive in making time in their schedules to see both the trainers and coaches, especially when something is hurting.

“The biggest injury would be shoulders,” said Stitch. “They can just point to where their shoulder hurts and we just already know what it is.” 

To combat the wear and tear of swimming on the body, the team engages in daily weight room preventative exercises, fuels with Gatorade Prime Chews and carbohydrate powder, Vitargo, and focuses on hydrating throughout the day.

“People probably don’t think about it with swimmers, but they sweat in the water so they don’t see it.” Stitch said. “It’s a little bit dangerous compared to other sports.”

The sports nutrition office and weight room also also offer a variety of ways to energize the swim team. Post weight sessions call for Protein bars and shakes while snacks such as mixed nuts line shelves and a rainbow of Gatorade stocks the nutrition office fridge. But energy intake doesn’t stop at food and water. 

“Our sport is so demanding, that it has to be a lifestyle in order to be successful,” Thompson said. “ You really want to make sure you get a good nights sleep.”

-INTERVEWING THOMSPON AGAIN ON A SPECIFIC MEET MEMORY/EXPEREIENCE WHERE THEY PLAYED “SHABBA” -

Traveling across the country to states like Texas, Minnesota and schools throughout the SEC is one of Thompson’s favorite parts of being a gator swimmer. In the locker room before his meet in ____, one of the seniors cranked up the sterero. “Shabba” by A$ap Ferg blasted the speakers 

“It’s this year’s go-to song,” Thompson said. “When we hear that, we get pretty amped.”
