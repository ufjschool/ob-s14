#Medium Story

Some call it extra-sensory perception. Some claim it is a sort of sixth sense. Others call it fake and a form of deception.

Whatever the view one may take, it is undeniable that there are many people who claim to have a variety of special powers that let them perceive beyond what the normal human can experience.  

There are energy readers who have the ability to see and manipulate the energy around humans. 

Psychics and fortunetellers will predict the future. Mediums will communicate with the dead and relay messages to the living. 

Their methods often range from eccentric to entirely nebulous, which is why there are so many who doubt the validity of their claims. These powers also have very little in the way of hard scientific support. 

So is it possible that certain human beings can perceive further than others?

“I do think that there are some people out there, maybe they are vulnerable to some things that the rest of us are just closed off to,” said Jillian Geis, a language arts teacher at Lincoln Middle School. 

Geis had a friend growing up who claimed to have psychic powers and would use cards to help her make decisions. This friend said her mother was a witch and that she had the powers in her blood.

While Geis would listen to the card readings, and in many instances she found that the cards’ predictions turned out to be right, Geis was still skeptical that her friend was really psychic.

“I think some people are extremely in tune with nature around them and they feel like they are special and they have this gift…but I don’t think she had that gift,” she said.

Geis did not take a firm stance one way or the other: while she said believed that some people could truthfully see the future or speak to the dead, she said it may just be a case of very intuitive people who can read others’ emotions. She did express a solid belief in the paranormal however, attributing it to her upbringing in Catholicism.

She said that her faith’s beliefs in exorcisms lead her to believe there must be other kinds of spirits and energy as well.  

“I’ve watched enough movies and heard enough stories to believe that, ‘Yeah, I bet some of this stuff did happen,’” she said. 



Belief is one thing, but definitive proof of psychic powers still eludes the mainstream scientific community, and by association the general public. However, there are fields of academic study concerned with researching the paranormal.
Andrew Nichols, who holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, teaches classes to the Gainesville community about honing psychic senses. He is also a parapsychologist, a practitioner of the field which explores how the human mind relates to things that exist beyond our typical five senses. 

He said he has had the ability to see energy since he was a small child. He called it the ability to see “auras,” which appeared to him as “misty luminescence,” similar to heat waves coming off of a sidewalk, but in different colors.
“For a long time I thought everyone could see them,” he said, “And I would always mention them and people would give me strange looks.”

He said eventually his aunt pulled him aside and told him he had “the sight,” and that he needed to stop talking about it and start learning to control it.

The color of an aura depends on many factors according to Nichols, such as intellect, health and emotional state. Every living being has them, including plants, which typically have a blue or bluish-white aura.

Blue is the most common color for human auras as well, but that can change, especially with emotional swings. Interestingly enough, many popular clichés coincide with auras: depression leads to a dark blue aura (“feeling blue”) and rage leads to a dark red aura (“seeing red”).

“I believe those terms found their way into our universal vocabulary because people can subliminally sense those subtle energies,” he said.

Beyond those common auras, most aura colors mean different things depending on the person they surround and the energy reader. Nichols said this is because auras and energy are not seen with the physical eyes, but with the mind’s eye. 
He also clarified that while the color is up for interpretation, the energy fields themselves are very real and can even interact with each other. This is why certain people have “chemistry” or instant feelings toward one another.

“A variety of experiments have shown that the energy fields do either attract or repel one another,” he said. “They have a sort of electromagnetic quality to them.”

These energy fields can also rub off onto other things and other people. Every interaction between an aura and a physical object can result in a sort of psychic residue of the person being left on that object. Nichols said that’s what causes most hauntings: people who previously lived in a place have left their impressions on the building itself.
This means people who claim to be energy readers can tell a lot of things about their subjects which would seem almost impossible to know; everything someone does leaves a mark on them. 


There is also the chance that mediums, who claim to speak to the dead, are merely reading the imprints of the deceased persons on the client.

Mediumship is one of the more highly investigated types of psychic practices by parapsychologists, leading to what 
Nichols called a “strained relationship” between mediums and researchers.  On the one hand, parapsychologists have done more to document mediums throughout history than any other researchers. On the other hand, parapsychologists have also exposed a lot of frauds.

Parapsychologists believe in auras and energy, and thus also believe in the merits of energy reading. Future-telling could be seen as more of a variation on energy reading and being able to make good predictions based on the evidence, as opposed to an actual prophetic sight.

The notion of being able to communicate with dead people, however, is still a hotly debated topic in the community, with no one really being able to give a definitive answer on how it is done. 
Primarily in history, there have been two main types of mediums: physical and mental. Physical mediums conducted their sessions in dimly lit rooms and would make objects fly around, tables shake and a substance called ectoplasm exude from their bodies. 

Physical mediums are rarer nowadays due to many of them being exposed as fakes. It was easy enough to make things move in a dark room and blame it on spirits, or exude a substance that looked like ectoplasm but that was really something more common. 

Mental mediums claim to hear the voices of the dead or see images in their minds and then relay it to their audience. The entirely internal experience makes it more difficult to disprove, but mental mediums still have their detractors. The most common argument is that they say such vague or obvious things that something they say is bound to have some significance to their client.

Nichols admitted that mediums do say vague and generic things, called “cold reading,” as a form of biding time, as they cannot turn on messages from the deceased at will. However, there will be a time when they say something so specific and so personal that they could have only known it from that deceased person. Nichols said that is proof that they must have some connection to a different source of knowledge.

There are two main theories about how mediums receive their information. One is the Super ESP theory, which says mediums can access knowledge from a sort of “cosmic database,” into which dead people’s consciousnesses have all melded together. The other is the Survivalist theory, which says mediums are communicating with actual and unique dead spirits. 
Both theories leave room for problems in the communication process. There is no indication that spirits behave any differently from their human counterparts or have any extra knowledge. They could lie, intentionally deceive, or just be mistaken in what they tell the medium.

In the Super ESP hypothesis, it is possible a medium might not be able to distinguish what comes from his or her own subconscious and what comes from the cosmic conscious. Parapsychologists generally accept the concept of extra-sensory perception but are unsure of its limits. It is entirely possible that everything a medium “hears” is coming from within themselves and not external sources.

Nichols said that many mediums are indeed biased by their personal beliefs. He also said the root of psychosis is when the unconscious material of a person’s mind takes over his or her conscious mind. 

He referred to mediums as “walkers between the worlds,” saying that is difficult for some mediums to function normally in the physical world, due to the problem of sorting of the streams of information from the conscious and the unconscious. He said this is why so many psychics act “kooky.”

He said many psychics can be perfectly functional and hold a job, but also many schizophrenics in psychiatric wards are psychics who have lost control of their ability to separate their conscious from the unconscious.

“The psychotic and the psychic are both immersed in the same sea,” he said, quoting his mentor, William Roll. “The difference is the psychic swims, the psychotic drowns.”

With so much debate about the nature of psychic abilities within the field of those who study it, combined with the flat-out rejection from many of the scientific community, the truth about psychic abilities may still be unclear for some time. However, Nichols said he believes that a scientific explanation is out there.

“I don’t think anything transcends nature,” he said. “Ultimately I think we will understand how these things work. This is really all about subtle energies.” 

“There is an essence, which emanates from living things, which saturates non-living things, which is capable under certain circumstances of creating chemical and biological effects, which is what we call the paranormal,” he said.

He said that the aura and the human bio-energy field have been discovered and re-discovered by scientists for centuries under different names: life force, ether and animal magnetism, to name a few. He said western science and medicine, which stopped believing in those specific theories in the mid-19th century, abandoned these concepts prematurely.

However, he said scientists are currently investigating these subtle and invisible energies again in the form of dark matter and dark energy, which they believe make up most of the universe. 

He also noted how, in medicine, energy healing is available for registered nurses to learn, and it is considered acceptable by many institutions. Energy healing is done by manipulating the body’s subtle energies, a process similar to the animal magnetism theory of the 18th century.

“It seems as though science is gradually catching up,” he said. “These discredited theories and philosophies of the superstitious are being re-embraced under new names. And nobody in my field is surprised.”

##Carolyn Green: Energy Nurse

The one word she described her work: fascinating.

She is not just any type of nurse. 

Carolyn Green is the official “Energy Nurse.”

Green assists in balancing the energy field in one’s body, also commonly known as the auric field.  The energetic system has an anatomy of its own.

“The advantage to that, is it helps to regulate the physical, mental and spiritual body to open the window of accelerated healing,” Green said. 

From her hometown of Northern Bronx, New York, Green saw and heard spirits since her earliest memories at 2 years old. She was hypersensitive to sounds and light. She was able to see and hear spirits, also known as clairvoyance and clairaudience. 

“It is like taking your basic senses to the second floor,” Green said. 

This ability was something she understood later on in life as functioning on a higher frequency level.  Today they refer to it more as HSP, higher sensory perception. 

* Jewish, believe in one God

* Works with a collective of over 20 angels and guides, to tune into, for info on the healing process of my patients. 

* Does a lot of grief work as well, since many departed loved ones make their presence known to me to help their family who are still grieving.

* Author of Getting to Know You: Guided Pearls; wrote the book because “The Spirit moved me!” channeled messages from a spirit that became the book, which was written in four months. 

* In the book, she mentioned 18 concepts of awareness that the guides and angels made her aware of to work through systematically to help re-establish healthier thought patterns in all aspects of life. They also teach how to learn to clear the mind clutter of past issues that affect our physical, mental and spiritual body.
