NOTE: I had a UF expert stand me up on an interview. This will include a bunch of student interviews on when they drink coffee and if they knew about the science behind coffee drinking. If I can't get a scientific expert, I'm going to go to the baristas interviewed and see if they busiest hours coincide with the the science.

After the alarm clock sounds and the maximum number of snoozes have been met, most Americans go straight to the coffee maker. 
According to the National Coffee Association, 83 percent of people drink coffee, but many are aiming for a pick-me-up at the wrong time. 
When it comes to drinking coffee for energy, earlier isn’t always the best choice.
If you’ve finished your morning cup of Jo or chugged an iced coffee between classes without feeling those normal jitters, there’s a reason why:
According to research by neuroscientist Steven Miller, people who use coffee to boost their alertness may just be drinking at the wrong time.
Chronopharmacology is the study of the interaction of biological rhythms and drug action, and one of the most important rhythms is your circadian clock. This internal clock lets you know when you’re hungry or exhausted.
Bodies produce what’s called cortisol, which is a hormone that controls alertness.
According to Miller’s research, drinking coffee won’t have the same effect when your body is already releasing cortisol.
Essentially, the best time to take a coffee break at work  is between cortisol peaks. 
Generally, a person’s natural alertness is at its highest between 8 and 9 a.m., noon and 1 p.m., and 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. So downing the caffeine during these hours won’t increase your energy levels – hope you’re buying that $5 mid-day cappuccino just for taste.

8 a.m. to 9 a.m.-- Cortisol time
9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. -- Drive to Starbucks
Noon to 1 p.m. -- Cortisol time
1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. -- Drive back to Starbucks
5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. -- Cortisol time
