###HAUNTED UF

Ghost stories are strange animals. Year after year you hear them in different voices, see them through different lenses. You can’t prove they exist but can never seem to put a figure on why they don’t. 

Tracing its roots back before the Civil War, the University of Florida has quite a past. This university has seen world wars and world peace, segregation and integration. It’s seen national championships. And like anything of a great age, this university has seen death. Lots of death.

With death and history comes the inevitable – the ghost story. 

###BEATY 

“The lights were all off”

It happened in Beaty Towers East, the third floor. Ben Dostovic was in his room trying to get to sleep, said then-sophomore Arianne Romero, 21, a friend of his. As he lay in bed he began to hear a familiar sound: the rolling chairs moving around in the kitchen area.

“He ignored it at first and tried going back to sleep,” Romero said, her voice filled with the thrill of telling a scary story.

Then, he heard something bang loudly against his door. Annoyed, he got out of bed and barged into the kitchen area, thinking it was his roommates messing around.

No one was in the room, and the lights were all off.

Dostovic checked the bathroom to make sure his roommates hadn’t ducked in there to hide. Nothing. Figuring they’d run back into their own rooms, he flung open their door.

Only one roommate was home, and he was sound asleep. When Dostovic woke him up, he had no idea what was going on.

And that was only the first time, Romero said. Another night, Dostovic was trying to fall asleep when he heard the sound again – chairs moving in the common room. No one was home.

He ignored it until he saw his doorknob turn, slowly.

“He didn’t go to sleep that night,” Romero said.

####A Little History

Jutting ungracefully out of the corner of 13th Street and Museum Road, Beaty Towers is a campus landmark and, to some, and eyesore. The coed dorm was somewhat eerily known as the “Twin Towers” when it opened in 1967, but was eventually named after professor Robert Calder Beaty (http://www.uff.ufl.edu/Facilities/Facilities.asp?ID=104). Beaty was a WWI veteran and former University of Florida Dean of Student Personnel who retired in 1960.

The UF housing history book (http://www.housing.ufl.edu/media/about/aboutus.historybookpdf.pdf) calls Beaty Towers an “architectural anomaly” on campus, because high-rise residential facilities were nonexistent at UF and scare throughout the southeast in general. Each of the 200 apartments in Beaty typically house four students, with two bedrooms, one bathroom and a common living area and kitchenette. 

The dorm opened in the midst of social change on college campuses, the book explains. 1967 said goodbye to dress codes and curfews for female students, and by the following summer, UF residential hall associations were no longer divided by gender.

Supposedly around that time, a girl jumped from her Beaty dormitory to her death.

####A suicide legend

Kids have died on the UF campus. Death is an inevitability among 50,000 students. Some of them have died in their dorm rooms, some in Beaty Towers. A simple Google search of “UF student died Beaty Towers” turns up old Gainesville Sun articles with details. One of the first to come up is a November 1987 write-up of the alcohol poisoning death of 18-year-old freshman Robert Stevenson, who was found in his dorm room at Beaty TowersEast (http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19871126&id=Hj9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D-oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3704,3048058).

Deaths like his are the ones few remember, the ones nobody talks about. For whatever reason, it is a death that nobody can prove actually happened that UF students hear about over and over.

From what I gather, it’s Gator household story that a female student committed suicide by jumping from her Beaty dormitory. Which tower was it? Which room did she jump from? What year did it happen? Nobody seems to be able to answer these questions, though they keep coming up. I even remember hearing the girl was pregnant when she jumped.

According to the people who should know, however, there is no record of a girl killing herself by jumping from Beaty. I contacted the one man who might know if anyone does: UF historian and curator Carl Van Ness.
An “American Girl”?

The suicide legend stems from the Tom Petty song “American Girl,” Van Ness said. A popular interpretation of the song is a girl contemplating suicide. The connection to the University of Florida and, specifically, Beaty Towers, comes from the second stanza:

Well, it was kind of cold that night,
She stood alone on her balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,
Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach.
And for one desperate moment
There he crept back in her memory
God, it’s so painful when something that’s so close
Is still so far out of reach.

U.S. Highway 441 is actually 13th Street in Gainesville, which runs right past Beaty Towers.

Tom Petty is a Gainesville native and would have seen the dorm many times.

“Speculation has always focused on Beaty Towers as it was the only building tall enough at the time,” Van Ness said.

However, he said he has never seen any records to indicate the song is based on an actual event. Also, anyone can look up at Beaty Towers and see that no balconies exist.

“How a ghost appears is another question,” he said. “Apparently, it is the ghost of 	someone who never existed.”

UF spokesman Steve Orlando echoes Van Ness in his claim that nobody has committed suicide by jumping from Beaty Towers, according to an August 2009 article from The Independent Florida Alligator (http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_28668d1f-4473-57b1-9d52-ddce62158263.html). Orlando said he has met Tom Petty in person and that the singer said the rumors were completely false.

Despite these repeated denials, the Tom-Petty-Beaty-Towers-suicide legend stubbornly lives on. Even the Wikipedia page for “American Girl” has a section devoted to the rumor. Whenever I hear that Tom Petty song, the looming shape of Beaty inevitably comes to mind.

#James Thieke 


James W. Norman Hall houses the University of Florida’s College of Education, named for the man who was the college’s dean from 1920 to 1941. The naming occurred in 1958, but the building itself opened in 1934. At that time, it housed P.K. Yonge Laboratory School, and rumors abound that an incident during that time has left Normal Hall haunted ever since.

“The legend is that, one day, three students got on the elevator when they weren’t supposed to,” says Larry Lansford, explaining that the old-style elevator was for faculty and staff only. “It went wrong, fell from the top to the bottom floor, and they were killed in it. So the legend is those three children are the ghosts of Norman Hall.”

He hands me a copy of an article he wrote about the legend for the summer 2005 edition of “Education Times.” He emphasizes that there is no written record confirming the validity of the legend, but he also concedes that there are many strange stories reported around Norman Hall.

A campus police officer quit his job after once, during an inspection, he found a room with a perfectly made bed, which upon his return in the morning had had its sheets tossed about, despite the door remaining locked. Two female students both reported feeling a presence in the first-floor unisex bathroom that brought them near tears. And people repeatedly claim to hear strange sounds and feel unusual presences on the third floor, especially by the water fountain. 

“I’ve never experienced any of it,” Lansford says. “I keep an open mind, but until I experience it, I’ll believe it when I see it.”
***
I volunteered to visit Norman Hall for my magazine team. While some people might shy away from haunted places, we are curious journalists, so naturally, we purposely go and hope to find some ghosts. My mission is to see if I experience similar phenomena as the people who report paranormal experiences. 

I arrive at Norman around 6:30 p.m. According to Tom Dana, associate dean of the College of Education, UFPD arrives around 10 p.m. to lock the doors. I plan to leave around 9:30 p.m., as to avoid any unnecessary run-ins with police. It’s already getting dark as I enter the building. 

I walk up the stairs to the third floor. The lights are all on in the hallways, but I don’t see any other people. There is a palpably creepy feeling in the staircase, but it may just be from lack of clean air; the staircase has a very mildewed smell. 

As I walk over to the water fountain, its cooling compressor shuts off, leaving the room suddenly quiet. *Not exactly a good omen*, I think to myself.

I put down my backpack and my umbrella and slouch against the wall next to the fountain. It’s now 6:45 p.m., and the sky outside is dark. The hallway is still deserted. I take a couple deep breaths and close my eyes.

“Which way means yes?” The pendulum swings up and down.

“Which way means no?” It swings left and right.

 “I don’t know?” It starts swinging in a circle.

It’s about three weeks earlier, and I’m sitting in the office of Dr. Andrew Nichols, a famous parapsychologist. In my hand, a pendulum is swinging different ways depending on the questions I ask it. It gets each one right.

Nichols tells me how when he was a child, he could see the auras around different life forms. After seeing a vision of his recently deceased sister, he started studying to become a parapsychologist. Now he has been the president of the American Institute of Parapsychology for 20 years. 

Nichols believes that every human being is capable of extra-sensory perception and therefore capable of experiencing paranormal occurrences. Some are naturally better at it than others; he compares the innate ability to an IQ, calling it a “Psi-Q.” 

As I mess around with his pendulum, he gives me advice on how to best perceive the energy in a haunted place.

“Get into a relaxed and receptive state of mind,” he says. He says that the best states of mind are the states when one is daydreaming and on the verge of sleep.  “And you must learn to suspend critical judgment while you’re doing it. Once you start second guessing yourself, it’ll stop.” 

He also recommends to sit in dim lighting and to go to the place where haunting is reported the most. Nichols says that magnetic field imbalances around certain places may enhance the perceptive abilities of humans.  His explanations for paranormal activity are rooted in the science. 

“I don’t really believe in the supernatural anyway,” he says. “All phenomena occur as events within nature. There are still large aspects of nature we know very little about.”
*** 
**7:00 p.m.** – The water fountain cooler kicks on with a snap and nearly gives me a heart attack. I had been close to dozing off. I am still very alone. The only indication that other people might be in the building are faint sounds to my right that sound like an elevator. To my left, as I had first started to drift off, I had heard a sound like a rattling of a small chain. I’m not sure what that could have been. Other than those sounds and the low hum of the air conditioner, it is still very quiet. I scribble down some notes on a sheet of paper and then close my eyes once again. 
*** 
I have a mixed background in the paranormal. My parents and my father’s side of the family are exclusively scientists. My mother’s side of the family is descended from gypsies, visits mediums on a regular basis and explores the mysticism of various cultures. I am also a devout Christian. So I have lots of conflicting influences when it comes to seeing ghosts.

The truth is, I want to believe. Even though every scientific bone in my body is screaming fraud, the concepts of spirits and psychic powers is too alluring for me to pass up. I believe that God exists; why not spirits as well?

So when Karen Owens, office manager of the English Language Institute, which happens to be located on the third floor of Norman Hall, tells me her family has a long history with the paranormal, I believe what she tells me.

“Someone that I know,” she says, “they’ve seen a little girl, down at the other end of the hall, when the old elevator still worked.” 

“When they go to the water fountain they can feel it, they can feel the presence. They won’t go anywhere near the elevator to this day, and they’re an adult now.” 

Claiming to have seen a full human ghost is tough to explain as something else. While sounds and presences can be blamed on the wind and emotions, reports of visions tend to be passed off as lies, because the only other “scientific” explanation is hallucination.  

But Daryl Bish, admissions coordinator for the institute, recalls a separate instance, where a teacher quit after swearing to have seen a little girl in the same hall. He doesn’t believe it though.

“It’s just a fun story,” he says of the haunting rumors. “I’ve been here at 1 a.m. It is creepier, no doubt.”
Owens, however, believes the stories. “Other people might say I’m crazy, but we’ve had things happen in our family, so I don’t doubt it at all.”
*** 
**7:15** – A girl’s voice.

It was soft and mumbled and really high-pitched, but I definitely heard a girl’s voice. It wasn’t in the hall either; it definitely sounded like it was being spoken into my mind.

Now I’m wide awake and not sure if I could have been dreaming. I was definitely a little spaced out, but I think I was still somewhat lucid. I definitely heard someone talking, and it was not like hearing someone from far away or from down the hall. It was like another voice just started speaking in my thoughts. 

I try to relax and slip back into my necessary state of mind, but I can’t stop thinking about the voice. For the first time tonight, I can hear my heart beating.
***
Nichols’ specialty is in investigating haunting cases, and he once even received a research grant from the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health. Nichols says that hauntings aren’t necessarily caused by spirits.

“They are a residue of past events, imprinted into the environment, that people pick up on,” he says. “Think of the house as a DVD. The energy we emit from our bodies saturates our surroundings, which includes information about your personality, memories and more, that it records on our surroundings.”

He says particularly violent or extreme events create longer-lasting impressions, as do repetitive events. He says most hauntings can last for decades or even centuries, as long as the building where the energy has imprinted remains.
***
**7:30** – There is a popular saying that “time flies when you’re having fun.” I am realizing the opposite is true as well: when you are doing nothing, time crawls at a sickeningly slow pace. Every little sound is magnified in the midst of the silence. I have heard the elevator-like noises coming from my right, as well as some creaks and moans from both sides of me. The water fountain’s cooler never fails to startle me. 

Getting a little tired of sitting and waiting, I decide to explore some other areas of the building. I walk around the hall to find the elevator. When the doors open, a loud bell dings. I would have definitely heard that from where I was sitting. That means what I was hearing wasn’t the elevator. 

The doors open and I step out on the first floor. Norman Hall is starting to make me paranoid. My heart skips a beat every time I open a door or turn a corner. So far I haven’t encountered anything or anyone else. That changes quickly as I hear a cough. 

I follow the sound of coughing to a break room with vending machines. At the other end of the room sits a man working on a laptop. I decide to approach him and tell him about my mission. He says I’m the only other person he’s seen in the last few hours. 

I ask him when UFPD locks the doors, and he says that they usually come at 11 p.m. He says he studies here often, and that he’s sometimes managed to stay until 1 a.m. without a problem. 

The prospect of an overnight stay is enticing, but Norman Hall is wearing on me. Every minute staying by that water fountain gets harder and harder. Walking the halls is unsettling. The stairs feel claustrophobic. I decide not to stay any longer than I originally planned. 

I pay the unisex bathroom on the first floor a visit. The two girls Lansford described were shaken to tears by this bathroom. I expect to feel the same creepiness I did by the water fountain, but it’s actually a fairly comforting place. It’s a large, bright bathroom with plenty of space and working amenities. If it is haunted, I don’t feel it.

Eventually I make my way back up to the third floor by route of the stairs at the other end of the building. By the time I sit down again it is 7:45 p.m. Looking around, I remember that Dr. Nichols advised me to be in dimly lit settings. The lights in the hallways are all still glowing bright.

I walk over to my left and flick one switch. The hallway to my left goes dark. There is still a bright light at the end of it, so I walk down and flick that light off too. I go to the right of the water fountain and turn out the light above that hallway.

Only the light in the center room remains on. After some searching, I go out to the stairwell and find that switch as well.

Now it is very dark. And I as I sit back down, I actually feel consciously afraid.
*** 
Have you ever had any kind of paranormal experiences here? I ask Owens.

“Not here, no,” she says.

How about other places?

Her eyes widen as she takes a breath and nods her head.

Do you care to talk about them?

She tightens her mouth and shakes her head.
***
**8:00 p.m.** – I’m jarred out of my reverie by noises from the stairwell. They were definitely coming from people. Not wanting to make an awkward scene by having people wander in on a dark hallway with a man sitting on the floor, I quickly jump up and start turning on the lights. 

I turn on the main light, the right hallway light, the left hallway light, and the light at the end of the hallway – revealing a box.

I stop and look down the hall. There is a small, brown, open box just sitting in the middle of the hallway. I walked down that hallway not 15 minutes earlier. I may not be the most observant person in the world at all times, but I would have noticed a box in the middle of my walking path. 

I walk down the hall and look inside. It’s empty. The information on the side indicates it was for the person in the nearest office.

I go back to my spot and turn the lights back off. The people never came to the third floor. My mind is racing. *Did I really not notice that box? If it wasn’t there, how did it get there? It’s so quiet around here, I would have heard footsteps.*
***
“Be an open-minded skeptic,” Nichols says. “Make your own judgment, but give yourself a chance to have a connection with the unknown. These experiences can be transformative.”
***
**8:15 p.m.** – My eyes have finally adjusted to the dark. I can now discern shadows from what previously looked like movement. I still hear the elevator-like noises. Once again I hear sounds coming from the stairwell. I decide I should take another trip through the building.

I descend to the first floor and return to the break room. The man with the laptop is still there, and he nods at me as I sit to jot down notes. After I finish, I walk over to talk to him.

He reveals himself to be Tyler Egan, an undergraduate botany student with aspirations of medical school. He says he works down the street from Norman, so it makes a good study location. Since he is often here late into the night, I ask him what he knows about the building.

Despite coming here for years, he is unaware of the haunted rumors. He says he knows about how old this building is, and that he has always been drawn to that. However, even though he often stays late, he has never had any paranormal experiences.

“Then again, I only ever come to the first floor,” he says. I observe that the well-lit, spacious break room has an entirely different feel than the third-floor water fountain. 

“All I ever see are rats and mice that run around here,” he says.

You see rats and mice?

“Yeah, they come out of that corner,” he says gesturing to a spot. “I haven’t seen them in the last few weeks though.”

He then also tells me that the first-floor men’s bathroom used to have a thin piece of metal loosely attached to the wall, and that pulling it back would reveal a small staircase going down. “Although I don’t know what down from here would be,” he says. “We’re on the ground.”

I go to the bathroom to confirm this. The thin metal he referred to has since been replaced by a much sturdier metal plate, with screws in it that are strong enough to fix it on, but loose enough to see there is definitely a lot of space behind it. The screws are big enough that I could probably unscrew them with my keys, but that would probably be illegal to do, so I don’t. 

*Ghosts, sounds, boxes, rats, and stairways…how much creepier can this building get?*
*** 
**8:45 p.m.** – Readjusting my eyes to the darkness is a pain, but I’m soon back in business in my spot by the water fountain. It’s much harder now. It’s not that I feel tired, but I feel almost heavier. When I sit next to the water fountain, it feels as though I constantly want to leave. I’m never comfortable.

A long time passes with nothing happening. Just as soon as I start to think it might be all in my head, the two hallways on either side of me dim. Then I hear a pop in the right hallway, followed immediately by the chain rattle from the left, followed by the crack of the water fountain cooler turning on. I think the universe is trying to teach me a lesson.

After 30 tense minutes, I decide to spend my final 15 minutes in Norman at another location.
*** 
“These are all stories,” Lansford says. “There are no names where you can verify that it happened.” 

In his article, Lansford writes about how the elevator where the children supposedly died was an old-style elevator, with a spring-loaded accordion-style gate. At the time of the article, 2005, students still had to use that elevator. ***
**9:15 p.m.** – It would look like just a normal brown, wooden door, if not for the big, red sign that reads, “ELEVATOR OUT OF SERVICE.” Just a couple of paces away is the new elevator; sleek, shiny and metallic.  I turn as many lights off as I can and sit down next to the old elevator.  

I keep waiting for the impending dread, or the weight of the world…but it doesn’t come. It feels as though I’m sitting in a normal hallway. It is actually the most normal I have felt all night. 

It gets to be 9:30, and so I end my mission on a confusing note. I leave the third floor, turning back on all of the lights as I go. As I step out into the night air, the weighty feeling doesn’t leave. I make it all the way back to my house before I feel any different.

I’m left to wonder about my experience. No ghosts, no visions, and no definitive signs of paranormal activity. I did always feel worse by the water fountain than anywhere else in the building. But it’s difficult to separate how much of that was actual paranormal activity, how much was my knowledge of its haunting, and even how much my fear of getting in trouble, even though I wasn’t breaking any laws of which I am aware.

Talking with Egan also made me wonder. He didn’t know about the hauntings, and he never had any paranormal problems. In fact, maybe Norman seems haunted because, as he pointed out, it is an old building. It creaks, moans, has stale air and even has rats from time to time. All of those things could explain lots of paranormal phenomena.

Still, there was that girl’s voice. And there was that mysterious box. I’ve had a while to think about it, and I still can’t explain either of them.
*** 
So is it possible that Norman Hall is truly haunted? Even though Lansford doesn’t yet believe it, it wouldn’t matter much to him.

“I like working here and I figure they haven’t harmed anyone if they are here, so you know, we can cohabitate together if they’re there,” he says. 

Owens feels similarly. “It doesn’t bother me, and I stay here after people have left.”

If Norman Hall is haunted, then staying around the paranormal energy could be beneficial. According to Nichols, the best way to learn about parapsychology is to go out and try it. And it is the trained parapsychologist’s duty to provide a road map.

“It is unlikely that mainstream science is going accept parapsychology anytime soon,” Nichols says. “That used to be our dream. It’s not going to happen.”

“We are not going to be able to find evidence that is going to be convincing, not without significant changes in the level of technology. What parapsychologists can do is help people experience these things for themselves, so they can make their own judgments.”

Nichols does say that more individual scientists, if not science as a whole, are coming around to seeing his field as legitimate. 

“These experiences are an important part of the human experience,” he says. “And no attempt to understand the human mind would be complete without considering these experiences.”

#Emilie Shinskie 

I was curious, curious about who these people were and skeptical about what they did. 

I walked into the Engineering Building on the UF campus at 7:50 p.m., looking for the white polo shirts he said they’d be wearing. 

On their website they claimed to be everyday people, passionate and interested in researching and investigating paranormal activity.  

Pete Bolejack, the founder of Florida Paranormal Investigations (FPI), and Stephanie Boothby, a member of the non-profit organization, shook my hand kindly. 	They were much gentler-looking than I had imagined and professional. 
“'I’ve never told anyone this before because I didn’t think anyone would believe me; they’d think I was crazy.’ I hear that one line; I’ve heard it dozens of times,” Boothby said. 

Boothby and Bolejack help explain the unexplainable. Along with the rest of their team, they investigate all things bizarre: the noises, the smells, the sightings. 

“It’s about helping people, helping them not be afraid in their own homes, giving them ways to deal with what’s going,” Boothby said. 

Humbled. That perfectly describes what I felt the rest of the evening. Boothby and Bolejack weren’t ghost hunters and they weren’t seeking a high or a thrill, but wanted to help people, people experiencing the abnormal, the paranormal.

“Paranormal activity is activity created by unknown forces that we do not understand,” Bolejack said. 
	
***This is a basic intro for my section of the haunted story. I spent some time with the Florida Paranormal Investigators. They are a non-profit based out of Gainesville that investigates paranormal activity for the sole purpose of helping others. They were extremely interesting people. There is much more I need to flesh out (an hour and a half of interview audio to go through). After spring break, I plan to add more about why they do what they do, exactly what they do (what an investigation looks like, etc.), and their thoughts on paranormal activity. There is a small possibility that I will have a chance to witness an investigation as well and include that in my story.  My contribution isn’t very complete at this point but I think has the potential to be pretty cool. ***
