Female distance runners from around the country glided down the lanes at New York’s Armory Center indoor track. Laura Steel, sidelined with Achilles tendonitis with her University of Pennsylvania jersey packed away in her travel bag, watched in envy – the leanness in their arms and legs, the ease in which they competed, running times she only dream of. 

“I wanted to know what their secret was,” said Steel, 24 (?), an alumnus of Penn seeking medical school at Jefferson University. “I remember thinking, ‘I bet they’re really healthy.’”

That was the start of struggle: the peak, the apex, the tipping point. 

Steel began her athletic and academic career at Penn in 2009 when she traveled across the country from Jacksonville, Fla., and enrolled as a freshman at the Industrial Ivy League school where city life and hard work collide. 

“The challenging environment made me feel often like I was treading water in a very deep ocean,” she said. “Just trying to keep my head above it and not look down.”

Top five on the Penn cross-country team as a freshman, Steel had set high standards for herself at the start of her first indoor track season. But when her Achilles left her limping after every practice, in hours of rehab a day (clarify this?), and jumping into a pool to aqua jog, she had nothing to keep her mental drive up. 

“I didn't even have track to give me some sense of fulfillment,” she said. “During this month or so, I decided I was going to channel that frustration into eating healthy.”

Slowly shedding pounds, Steel had begun to improve on the track. But eight months later, what had started as good intentions left her with her weight and GPA dropping faster than snow in Philly a December day.  

“I didn’t weigh myself everyday, but I knew,” she said. “I started avoiding people – and doing these things I would not normally do.”<< Need specifics!!!

It wasn’t until her roommates threw a pancake breakfast that she realized her relationship with food, and with herself, had deteriorated. Something within her told her not to eat the pancakes – that she wasn’t allowed. Concerned for her health, her friends had urged her to eat – pushing the food directly in her direction. At that moment, Steel saw the rules dictating her life and the anxiety choking her.

“I felt cornered and attacked,” Steel said, “And it took me admitting to myself that I had a problem before any healing could even begin – and that was tough.’”

Turning to a friend and former member of the Penn track team, Steel poured out the feelings that had literally been eating her up for half a year: feelings of inadequacy in her sport, being too self-critical, but above all, feelings of not being good enough. Her friend immediately searched all over for doctors and specialists who could help Steel.  

“After one year of doctors appointments, counseling sessions, and nutritionist visits, I had gained back enough weight to begin competing,” Steel said. “And those women are the reasons why I want to be a doctor.”

The road to recovery was by no means easy.

“I was very sneaky,” she said. “Before weigh-ins, I would chug water or wear the thickest sweaters I owned. But they held me accountable every step of the way.” 

According to Steel, she was labeled "the sick girl,” and such labels can have a powerful effect on anyone 

So powerful in fact, that sports counseling and psychology has only recently become a profession of its own, and many D-I schools have yet to hire a sports counselor directly affiliated with their athletic departments. Why? The negative stigma that comes with counseling could offer up one answer. 

In fact, Jaime Jenkins, a sports counselor affiliated with the University of Florida, didn’t even know her profession existed before coming to UF where she ran hurdles on the track team and studied exercise science. Now, with a PhD in mental health counseling, though not a part of the UF staff, owns her own private practice in Gainesville and works primarily with UF student-athletes.

“We’re investing a lot more and expecting a lot more of our student athletes,” Jenkins said. “ And if we don’t support them to balance that out, we’re going to see more anxiety, more depression.” 

Jenkins was inspired by her own experiences and struggles as an elite D-1 athlete to pursue a profession in sports counseling. << Need specifics!!!

“Athletes at this level a lot of times are developmentally delayed because they have been spending all of their time training,” she said. “They don’t have the same luxuries as everyone else does to date, go abroad, or even to study.”

Jenkins’ office, adorned with comfy couches and decorated with plush pillows, offers students a space to forget about 6 a.m. stadiums, vent about coaches, or anything else that they are struggling with and could potentially be holding them back in their sport. She also meets with them on campus in sports nutrition for better convenience.

“If [student athletes] have someone telling them what to do every moment of the day, managing their every minute, and they’re not having any opportunities to explore who they are and what they want,” she said, “then they need someone to step in an advocate for them.”
For Jenkins, it’s about the person, not the athletic performance.

“They’re not robots, they need permission to just be who they are,” she said. “Anybody who focuses on results or performances as the end all be all is really neglecting the whole process.”

UF employs full time nutritionists, strength coaches, athletic trainers, and doctors to work one-on-one with athletes in all 13 sports – but not a sports psychologist. While affiliated with the school, Jenkins is only employed at UF by contract. In other words, the university could drop her at any moment with no strings attached. Why? She doesn’t know. 

“Job security is my biggest challenge,” she said. “Even though you have sports psychologists at other D-1 schools like Ole’ Miss and LSU actually traveling with the athletes to away meets.” <<Double check this quote on recorder.

Nicole Noyes, a doctoral student at the Indiana University Bloomington, believes the answer lies in the stigma attached to the title of “mental health counselor.” 

“For a domain that prides itself on toughness, addressing mental health is often seen as grounds for failure or weakness,” she said. “On the contrary, de-stigmatizing mental illness may actually lead to better performance outcomes and greater resources for athletes.”

The psychological tolls elite athletes undergo is rising, and the headlines are showing. Michael Sam, a University of Missouri football player, and Madison Holleran, a distance runner at Penn, both recently committed suicide, shattering hearts around the country.

“[Holleran’s death] really hit home for many of us, because if we did not see ourselves in her shoes, we have close friends who we know felt her same pressures,” said Steel, who graduated Penn the year after Holleran had started her freshman year. “What I hope the younger members of the team can hear is no matter what fight you are fighting, you do not have to fight alone.”

Steel said that the combination of her doctor, nutritionist and counselor was the support system that saved her life, and if a school does have these resources, more athletes should take advantage of them. Noyes, who competed in crew at Holy Cross University, also wished she had support resources to help her through her four years as a collegiate student-athlete. 

“Sport psychology consultants can make it a point to promote services to coaches and teams,” Noyes said. “But coaching staff and administration need to be willing to actively support and promote this access.”

While athletes need energy for the mind as well as the body, Andrea Waterman, 19, a second-year industrial engineer major at UF, believes that’s the difference between an athlete and someone who is just athletic: the latter uses sports as a way to de-stress, not add stress.

Waterman is what you would call a gym freak. Between memorizing Study Edge formulas, pulling all-nighters for Calc II exams, as well as maintaining a social life, a day doesn’t go by where Andrea doesn’t attend a Southwest Rec fitness class or runs stadiums at the Swamp.

“Being fit and active just makes you feel better about yourself in every aspect – mentally and physically,” she said. “It just gives you that burst of energy and confidence that you normally wouldn’t have if you just didn’t work out.”

Like Steel, Waterman too has struggled with body image. While it didn’t foster itself through a sport in her life, she admits to having used exercise as a way to lose weight.

“When it comes to body image, comparison is the devil,” she said. “In middle school I always struggled with body image – Seeing all the little petit girls wearing Abercrombie size XS – It kinda hurt inside cause you know you’ll never be that person.”

Maturity, growth and experience showed Waterman perspective: that everyone is different and society has warped perfection throughout the ages. << Need Specifics

“Society has changed recently especially by advertisements and different images of perfection,” she said. “And once you start comparing yourself to those people or models or whoever it is, even if its like your really skinny friend, that’s when you start to doubt yourself.”

Like Waterman, Michael Andrito, 25, was also a recreational athlete at UF. A public relations major who graduated in ____, Andrito used flag football intramurals, softball frat leagues, and 5K runs to relieve him of the wear and tear of UF academia. 

“Mental motivation came most into play in the training,” he said. “When I’d do weight training, I always held onto this idea that ‘champions are made in the offseason.’” 

***NEED ANOTHER SOURCE THAT PERTAINS PARTICULARLY TO THE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESSES AND HOW ATHLETES CAN BENEFIT FROM GETTING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING***

^^Waterman and Andrito don’t really fit into the story’s purpose  – I was trying to use them as sources that would be relatable to non-athlete UF students, but I may have to find another way or other sources. More reporting is needed.
