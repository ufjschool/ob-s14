The all nighter – a rite of passage that’s part of the college experience. As hard as student might try to avoid staying up all night before a major exam, they still find themselves find themselves up during the early morning hours chugging caffeine to get themselves through the studying the need to get done.

According to GatorWell, seven to 10 hours of sleep are ideal for staying healthy and energized.  Despite the research, students still succumb to the need to stay up all night to study for an exam or write a research paper last minute, and they have different methods of beating the drowsiness.

Sarah Gaies does not like to stay awake all night studying, but she said it does happen.  Gaies, a 20-year-old health science sophomore said that the latest she’s ever stayed up because of school is until 8:30 a.m. because she had to write a paper. 

Gaies said she never acquired a taste for coffee and didn’t like the artificial taste of energy drinks, describing them as “plastic-y.”  Instead, the health science sophomore said she eats chocolate.
“This is weird, but I like to eat to chocolate,” Gaies said.  “It keeps me awake, and I like having it as a reward.”
Consuming caffeine can have adverse affects on sleeping patterns in general.  Coffee contains anywhere between 100-350 mg. of caffeine.  Chocolate has about 8 mg. per ounce.  Even pain relievers like Midol can have caffeine in them and affect sleep.

Virginia Somers, a graduate student, said she had really bad study habits as an undergraduate student.  The 23-year-old veterinary medicine major said she would avoid coffee because she hated the taste.  Her typical choice for a caffeine jump-start was Mountain Dew.  If she really needed to pull a traditional all-nighter, she would depend on 5-hour ENERGY to get her through the day.

Sleep myths are a common problem that leads to this behavior.

Sleep myth number one is that cramming all night long for exam will help improve grades.  Studies have proven that this wrong.  Getting a good night’s sleep will do more to help grades than staying awake trying to absorb information.

Myth number two is that taking naps can help you catch up on the hours of sleep that have been missed.  This disrupts normal sleeping patterns.  Sleeping in and taking naps do not help.  In fact these habits make it harder to normalize sleeping patterns to a health level.

Sleep myth number three is that sleeping pills are the solution to fixing the problem of not being able to fall asleep after developing a bad sleeping pattern.  In reality, studies show that changing sleeping habits are more effective than taking pills.

As a graduate student, Somers said she has learned from her past mistakes and tries to avoid staying up all night and having to take the 5-hour ENERGY drinks.

“It tastes really bad,” Somers said. “It’s really sour and tastes like the fluoride you get when you go to the dentist and cough syrup.”

She said 5-hour ENERGY was always effective at keeping her awake for the full five hours, but it made her crash afterward.  She said better study habits and trips to the gym have been better at keeping her energy level up.
