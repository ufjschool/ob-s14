CYM:

Nestled off of NW eighth Avenue, CYM Coffee Co. is known to its regulars as a home away from home. With a wrap around porch, bean bag chairs and a fat cat that permanently resides on a bench outside, CYM aims to reach out to the community, fostering creativity.
Meet your barista: Tom Thorkildson, a 41-year-old musician and bartender who has been with CYM since it opened its doors in 2012. When he’s not behind the counter, he might be playing guitar at CYM’s open mic night on Thursdays.

Q. Why CYM? What makes it different?
A. Well I think that just everything here, the whole cymplify community, we have other stores than just the coffee shop. We really try to focus on quality and customer service. It’s pretty typical of most coffee shops, though. We have a pretty laid back atmosphere.

Q. What’s the best part about working at CYM?
A. I love the job here, I love cym, there is really nothing bad about it.

Q. What’s the worst part about working at CYM?
A. I can’t even think about something bad about it. It’s just great.

Q. It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A. I like to steer people into trying coffee from different places and different origins. I start people off, if their interested, in trying different types of coffee and then we get into different brew methods. I usually try to do something that will compliment the flavor of the coffee, but we have a lot of cool specialty drinks that are cool and fun.

Q. What’s the most popular drink?
A. Mint Mocha

Q. When I’m hyped on coffee, I ___________
A. I do math better?

Q. What’s a normal day like at CYM?

Q. What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at CYM?
A. Because we have nursery, we often see wildlife we’ve seen fox and eagles and all sorts of different raptors. Some egrets come down and hangout. Seems like there’s always something funny going on around here. A fox showed up on our front porch one day.

Q. Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A. I’m always here, I really don’t go to any other coffee shops. 

Q. If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A. Original.

Q. What’s something most people don’t know about CYM?
A. It stands for Change Your Mind.

BARISTA INTERVIEW: Karma Cream

Its name fits its purpose. 

With a drive to use solely organic ingredients and provide vegan-friendly options to customers, Kyle Fick, 29-year-old owner of Karma Cream, said he opened it with the intention of starting a business that was cruelty-free and socially responsible. 
“Everything here is organic—our milk—it’s all grass-fed, hormone-free treated cows. My wife, she’s vegan. I’m vegetarian myself.  So there was kind of a purpose to this as well than just making money and scooping ice-cream. This is kind of a means to the end. I’d rather have an option that people might feel better about.”
And that’s how he came up with the name, Karma Cream. 
After graduating with a political science degree at the University of Florida, Fick started working in restaurants and sales and making music before deciding he wanted to do something on his own. 
“I kind of from early on didn’t want to work for anyone else and wanted to play by my own rules,” he said. “So far it’s working out.”
Fick has been the owner for almost five years, since Karma Cream opened in April 2009 on West University Avenue. Meet the barista, Kyle Fick:


Q. What inspires you? 
A. I play guitar. I’m in a local band called Sunshine State. We like to jam out. We go out of town a lot.

Q. Why Karma Cream? What makes it different?
A. We are committed to sourcing everything [as] organic as possible. For one, it’s much better for the planet. It’s much better for harvesters. It’s much better for the animals. Plus, you go out and get a coffee or latte and there’s a big mark-up there. It’s very cheap to brew a cup of coffee, so why not make sure it’s the best? You go to a restaurant and usually it’s a terrible ingredient and they make 20 bucks for a plate—something you can make at home with better ingredients. I kind of felt the logic behind marking up something that.

Q. What’s the best part about working at Karma Cream?
A. I love when people are just so happy with what they get here. We have a lot of people who are vegan or lack-toast intolerant, and the fact that they can eat things that they could never eat. To make people genuinely happy—I mean, that’s something that you expect from a kid, but grown people that are just so happy, that’s such an awesome thing to be a part of.

Q. What’s the worst part about working at Karma Cream?
A. Just the responsibilities of being an owner; to try and juggle the responsibilities of working here all the time to taking care of all the back-end things as well. Wearing a lot of different hats. It’s a challenge for sure, but it’s working out.

Q. It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A. I first ask what you’re here for. We have ice cream. At least 50 percent of our sales are ice cream and the rest is our date stuff or coffee. I think our ice cream is amazing. It’s organic, and we can even combine two with ice cream floats. So, we can get weird with it, for sure.

Q. What do you recommend out of the coffee options?  
A. I recommend an almond milk latte. A lot of people want something different than dairy or want something different than soy. I like to keep it classic: a shot of espresso with some milk.

Q. What’s the most popular drink? 
A. The special right now, the Lavender Earl Grey Latte. We’ve been trying to add a lot of new things. We change the specials about once a month. We might change a special into a main item. A lot of it is just employee ideas. They just experiment. 

Q. When you’re hyped on coffee, you ______
A.I actually don’t drink much coffee for that reason. I’ve always been pretty high-energy myself. When I drink coffee, I’m pumped. I’ll be running all over the place. I can do anything. It’s like a drug.

Q. What’s a normal day like at Karma Cream?
A. In the mornings, it’s pretty slow, and I’ll get things open and I’ll start baking cupcakes, baking croissants. We make vegan croissants as well. That’s a new thing that’s come out that ‘s been very popular. We get a rush around lunch. We do have some sandwich options that are vegan-friendly, so people come here and guarantee they’ll get something vegan. It stays pretty steady until about 7 or 8 p.m. when we get the evening ice cream crowd and studiers. A lot of studiers come out. We have free Wi-Fi. We’ll stay pretty busy till late in that night. That’s why we close at 1:30 a.m. A lot of cafes close at like 7 or 8 p.m. We used to be open until 3 a.. We tried 24 hours for a bit.

Q. What is the ratio of people who study alone to people on dates or with friends? 
A. 50/50. Every day, all day, at a table, you’ve got someone studying or hanging out and studying. Everyone’s doing something now on their iPhone  or iPad.

Q. What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at Karma Cream?
A. Homeless people hanging around, but we don’t get too much of that. It could be worse.

Q. What is the ratio of regulars to first-timers?
A. We have dailies and we have a lot of first-timers. If someone doesn’t look familiar, I’ll ask if they’ve been here before. There are new people every day. I’d say we get more regulars, and then first-timers become regulars. It’s the circle of life.

Q. Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A. This is definitely it. There will be other baristas who come here too [from other coffee shops], which is weird. I mean, this is the go-to place. I’m pretty proud of that. I don’t know of other places that do organic milk off the top of my head. That’s a huge deal.

Q. If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A: I’d say karma. That’s kind of why we named it. It was an alliteration, so that’s always a go-to. I’m not a Buddhist or Hindu, but definitely when I think of karma—realizing where and how you get products—you definitely have that purpose in mind that you know you put good karma back out there. 

Q. What’s something most people don’t know about Karma Cream?
A. We have fair trade. It took a year to open, which is a terrible thing. It was a smoke shop. It was a complete wreck in here. Everything was tore up. It wasn’t intended to be a café. It was kind of a weird set-up. We had to do lot of work to get this place to make any kind of sense. It’d definitely small. We’ve outgrown it, so we do our best to meet the demand. We certainly need more space. I try to be pretty conservative. It’s best to work with what you have until you’re 100 percent sure you’ve outgrown it. In the meantime, you should play it safe and don’t mess with the formula.


Fick said he never thought he would become an owner of a coffee shop.
“I’d never had a business before. I’m very fortunate and lucky that this has worked out really well—to make a living at least.”
Fick said his intention from the start was to focus on selling ice cream and coffee. “We see coffee grow a lot and we have to do a lot with very little amount of space,” he said. “We can get backed up pretty easy on a busy day just because demand is definitely going up since we opened.”

BARISTA INTERVIEW: Maude’s:



Meet your barista: Layne Wrighton, 26, has made her contribution to Maude’s since the age of 9, even if it meant having towel-folding competitions with her sister. Her father, Maude’s Owner Matthew Wrighton, opened the coffee shop about 19 years ago. 
“It was really fun watching it build,” she said. 
Wrighton started officially working at Maude’s about six years ago, first hosting, then serving and then working the register. She later became a barista while getting trained to bake, which is something that she has always wanted to do. 
“I’m always making coffee. I’m always the barista.  I’m always the registered person. Sometimes, I get to do baking or make a food order, which I really like," she said. "For making coffee, I’ve gotten really good at my foam now, so I’m really excited about dabbling in foam art.”
When she’s not a barista or baker, she’s an artist, volunteering as a seamstress and doing costume design. 
“I do costumes for myself and then I did an art show for a friend of mine. She directs plays and she asked me to do the costumes for a play that she did. This is kind of my community service but also my art outlet as well,” she said.  Other than artistic passions, Wirghton loves reading books.
“I actually just got done reading Harry Potter,” she said. “This is like the fourth time. I’m just reverting back to childhood—going back and remembering all those great books I read as a kid.”


Q. What inspires you?
A. Good-tasting food. I’m a bit of a people-pleaser, so definitely making a customer happy, doing foam art, having fun while I’m here.

Q. Why Maude’s? What makes it different?
A. I’ve had some opportunities to get jobs at other places, and I’ve been here for six years now, so there’s definitely motivation to hang on, and part of that is definitely my dad and that our relationship has been able to grow since working together. He’s very easy to work for and with. The way we do the hiring here is that the employees hire, so you’re always able to choose the people you want to work with. Everybody hangs out outside of Maude’s and everybody does enjoy each other’s company when we are here. Nobody has gotten into any fights.” 

Q. What’s the best part about working at Maude’s?
A. Getting to do specials, coming up with really awesome soups, just being able to do new creative stuff all the time and really push my limits as a baker. Our core menu stays the same, but we always have specials going.  We do a lot of gluten-free specials. 

Q. What’s the worst part about working at Maude’s?
A.  Having to ask people to leave. Normally, that involves very drunk and/or homeless people getting aggressive. I don’t want to do it, and it just makes me anxious. 

Q. It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A. I’ll usually recommend the special we have going, which changes every few days depending on how well it’s selling, or I’ll just suggest a regular cup of coffee. The Maude’s iced coffee is our signature iced coffee and that’s really good. We’re doing the dark chocolate cherry latte right now, which is one that I came up with.

Q. What’s the most popular drink?
A: Our black iced coffee or just a regular cup of coffee. A lot of chai teas. 

Q. When you’re hyped on coffee, you ____
A. I usually start stalking everything, cleaning, and usually chatting up customers way too much. I get silly, and I get really efficient. 

Q. What’s a normal day like at Maude’s?
A. The early mornings are not super busy. We usually have one or two people coming in, so we can do baking and stuff.  Once it gets closer to 11 a.m., we have a lot more people coming in for breakfast as well as lunch. Definitely afternoons have been a lot busier lately where people are ordering lunch. It definitely always slows down once it gets closer to 5 or 6 p.m., because we still serve food into the evening, but it’s not really a dinner menu. We have people coming in at night on dates and coming in to study. So, the nights are a little bit slower overall compared to the daytime. 

Q. What is the ratio of regulars vs. first-timers?
A. Regulars come in every day. There are maybe like 10 to 20 regulars that I see every time I’m here, maybe even more than that. More than anything, the regulars keep us afloat, but I’ve noticed over the last year, we’ve had a lot more people here for the first time. Now, I feel like it’s become even. It’s always fun when people come in and they’re showing someone else around like it’s their first time.

Q. Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A. Oh yeah, for sure. I’ve actually been wanting to try out the coffee shop that they have in the CMC because a couple of my friends work there, but it’s such a habit to just come here first. There’s always somebody sitting outside that I know or I’m friends with.

Q. If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A. Soul. It’s got soul. For a while, I thought we had ghosts here, so there might actually be some souls here.

Q. What’s something most people don’t know about Maude’s?
A. Usually that it used to be at the Big Lou’s location. A lot of people are surprised by that, even if they’ve been coming here forever. I don’t think anybody knows the owner [Matthew Wrighton] used to be a DJ for 10 years. 

Q. Any other comments about Maude’s? 
A. Well, we’re talking about expanding. I’m really excited about that, and it means I get to dive further into the menu and expand the menu and bring some tapas, so, we’re about to do some revamping. I really hope that it brings even more people in. The place next door emptied out, so we’re talking about knocking down parts of walls and opening up the front windows again. I’m hoping to do more specialty cake orders with the expansion and more baking and be able to eventually make our own bread.


Wrighton said group dates and double dating are really popular. She said she has noticed a lot of people doing online meets and blind dates at Maude’s. 
“I think it’s a really big place for that, which I find really endearing because it means that they trust us,” she said. “They feel like this is a comfortable place for them to come, and that’s really awesome.”

Bay Island’s Barista Interview

Jayme Brockman, 31, is the General Manager at Bay Island Coffee Co. Originally from south Florida, Brockman has now worked in the tiny coffee hut for almost two years. Aside choosing the best ingredients and making sure to know his customer's names, Brockman said it's important to make the coffee with a smile. Meet your barista, Jayme Brockman:



Q. Why Bay Island? What makes it different?
A. Because we’ve got the best stuff in town. We’ve got the best ingredients, and we order in small quantities so everything is fresh.

Q. What’s the best part about working at Bay Island?
A. It’s definitely the customer interaction. Here it’s all about knowing peoples names because, you know, we have a small team. It’s only about four of us. And we all have a different routine and coffee-making smile, but we all try to make people happy.

Q. What’s the worst part about working at Bay Island?
A. I have to say it’s the time. Waking up early so we can open by seven isn’t fun. Especially after Superbowl Sunday. 
Q. It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A. It depends on what they want. If you want a hot drink i’d recommend either a cup of coffee - we have different coffee beans from all over the world every month - or a mocha latte because everyone likes chocolate. You can’t go wrong with that. If you want an iced drink, get a caramel latte - that’s my favorite. But if you want frozen, then the frozen cappuccino is the way to go. 

Q. What’s the most popular drink?
A. The iced coffee in any flavor. Some people get it with coffee ice cubes so when the ice melts in doesn’t become watery.

Q. When I’m hyped on coffee, I _____
A. Work faster. I probably have one or two cups of coffee depending on how long i’m working. But I always have at least one.  

Q. What’s a normal day like at Bay Island?
A. I mean, It’s nothing that’s always the same. I make coffee. People order different things. During the weekend we get more food orders and more students.  

Q. What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at Bay Island?
A. I just get weird orders. One person gets a raspberry-coconut smoothie. It just seems like a weird combination but it’s actually pretty good.

Q. What is the ratio of regulars vs. first-timers?
A. The regulars know. Some will switch up their drinks but there are regulars always get the same thing. I know what they’re getting and I can pre-make it. The first-timers don’t really branch out in the menu. 

Q. Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A. For sure. Unless i’m out of town. But if i’m in town this is the only place I visit. 

Q. If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A. Excellent. I mean... we’re pretty awesome. 

Q. What’s something most people don’t know about Bay Island?
A. That we’re here, I mean... We’re pretty small. But other than that I would say some our menu options. We have a pretty big menu for such a tiny place. For example, not many people order our milkshakes. We also have a few off-menu items like a the Differccino, which is an iced cappuccino with two different syrup combinations - I like combining white chocolate and sugar-free hazelnut. We also have the Bay Island Shake, which is a combination between a smoothie and a milkshake.

Kyle Hayes, a 20-year-old English major at UF, has only worked at Barnie's Coffee and Tea Co. for a few months, but is obsessed with coffee. When he's not brewing a cup of Jo, he might be working on writing an article for The Fine Print. Meet your barista, Kyle Hayes:





Q. Why Barnie's? What makes it different?
A. I really like the atmosphere. I've had a few jobs. I hadn't had a job before a year ago, but in the past year, this is my third job, and it's by far the best work environment. It's just very relaxed. And also, I'm obsessed with coffee, so it works that I work at a coffee shop.

Q. What’s your best part about working at Barnie's? 
A. Honestly, the best part is that usually, like 9 times out of 10, I'm glad to be here and not wishing I was at home. With other jobs, I would just be like, I don't want to be here right now. But with here, I don't mind it. We talk in the back and we just make coffee ... The drinks definitely don't hurt.


Q. What’s the worst part about working at Barnie's? 
A. If I want to go to a party or something on the weekend, I'll be getting there at like 12:30 a.m. That's the worst part is that every time I work, I usually close when I work, so that means I'm getting off in the middle of the night.

Q. It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A. My new favorite drink is a London Fog, which is steamed milk, vanilla and just Earl Grey tea. And most people don't know about it.


Q. What’s the most popular drink? 
A. Probably, like, a white mocha.


Q. When I’m hyped on coffee, I ______
A. Pace in the back room.


Q. What’s a normal day like at Barnie's? 
A. Normal day is like, I show up out of it, get some coffee and I'm like, 'Alright, ready to go.' Sometimes it's busy out here, sometimes it's not. But just make drinks slash chill in the back until 8:30 p.m., and that's when I start closing, chores and stuff. From then on till close, I'm pretty much busy the whole time.


Q. What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at Barnie's? 
A. This woman just, like, spilled a drink and had me clean it up but didn't get up. So I was having to bend down right with her, and she just wasn't moving, wasn't doing anything. That was bizzare.

Q. Regulars vs. first-timers? 
A. Yeah I'm starting to memorize drinks. We have the guy, Bender. He comes here like every day and gets the same sugary drink. It's his own drink. It's called a Bender. It's two pumps chocolate, one pump caramel, one pump hazlenut, one pump vanilla, I think, and then whipped cream and a caramel drizzle on top. And there's espresso, but I don't know if you could even taste it with all that sugar.


Q. Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A. No. I live right next to the Coffee Culture on Newberry, so that would be the place I usually go to. Because it's so far, [most people] haven't been out here, but when they do come, they're, 'Well, this is a really good study spot.' So if I needed to study, this would be a good place.


Q. If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be? 
A. Coffee ... or just like a relaxed place.


Q. What’s something most people don’t know about Barnie's? 
A. Most people don't know that not every coffee shop uses grande, tall. Most people that don't come here don't know we serve beer and wine. That's a big part of at night, a lot of people come here for that. We have big jazz nights where a lot of people drink. Most people just assume it's coffee.
