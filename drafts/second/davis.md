Female distance runners from around the country glided down the lanes at New York’s Armory Center indoor track. Laura Steel, sidelined with Achilles tendonitis with her University of Pennsylvania jersey packed away in her travel bag, watched in envy – the leanness in their arms and legs, the ease in which they competed, running times she only dream of.

“I wanted to know what their secret was,” said Steel, 24, an alumnus of Penn seeking medical school. “I remember thinking, ‘I bet they’re really healthy.’”

That was the start to the mind games. For Steel, her mental battle was an eating disorder. For some collegiate student-athletes, it’s coping with depression after a losing season. For others, it’s completely disintegrating under the pressure to meet high standards in the classroom as well as on the playing field. For many, being a student-athlete at any school becomes about perfectionism, having a never-ending hunger for victory and being hit with a feeling that no one else could ever understand.

For Steel, her athletic and academic career had begun at Penn in 2008 when she traveled across the country from Jacksonville, Fla., and enrolled as a freshman at the Industrial Ivy League school where city life and hard work collide.

“The challenging environment made me feel often like I was treading water in a very deep ocean,” she said. “Just trying to keep my head above it and not look down.”

Top five on the Penn cross-country team as a freshman, Steel had set high standards for herself at the start of her first indoor track season. But when her Achilles left her sidelined from workouts and jumping into a pool to aqua jog, she had little left to keep her mental energy up.

“I didn't even have track to give me some sense of fulfillment,” she said. “During this month or so, I decided I was going to channel that frustration into eating healthy.”

Slowly shedding pounds, Steel had begun to improve on the track. But eight months later, what had started as good intentions left her with her weight and GPA dropping faster than snow in Philly on a December day. (< I don’t know how I feel about this last sentence. I kind of don’t like it, what do you think editor? How can I change it? Should I just cut the whole snow thing?)

“I didn’t weigh myself everyday, but I knew,” she said. “I would sometimes lie about things to avoid meeting people for meals and was extremely agitated all the time.”

It wasn’t until her roommates made a pancake breakfast that she realized her relationship with food, and with herself, had deteriorated. Something within her told her not to eat – that she wasn’t allowed. Concerned for her health, her friends pushed the food directly in her direction. At that moment, Steel saw the rules dictating her life and the anxiety choking her.

“I felt cornered and attacked,” she said, “And it took me admitting to myself that I had a problem before any healing could even begin, and that was tough.”

Turning to a friend and former member of the Penn track team, Steel poured out the feelings that had been eating her up for half a year: feelings of inadequacy in her sport, being too self-critical, but above all, feelings of not being good enough. Her friend immediately searched all over for doctors and specialists who could help Steel.

“After one year of doctor's appointments, counseling sessions and nutritionist visits, I had gained back enough weight to begin competing,” Steel said. “And those women are the reasons why I want to be a doctor.”

The road to recovery was by no means easy.

“I was very sneaky,” she said. “Before weigh-ins, I would chug water or wear the thickest sweaters I owned. But they held me accountable every step of the way.”

And before she made a full-recovery, filled with personal-bests on the track her senior year, she was still labeled "the sick girl.” And labels can have a powerful effect on anyone.

So powerful, in fact, that sports counseling and psychology has only recently become a profession of its own, and many D-I schools have yet to hire a sports counselor directly affiliated with their athletic departments. Why? The negative stigma that comes with counseling could offer one answer.

Jaime Jenkins, a sports counselor affiliated with the University of Florida, didn’t even know her profession existed before coming to UF, where she studied exercise science. Now, with a PhD in mental health counseling, she owns her own private practice in Gainesville and works primarily with UF student-athletes.

“We’re investing a lot more and expecting a lot more of our student athletes,” Jenkins said. “And if we don’t support them to balance that out, we’re going to see more anxiety, more depression.”

Jenkins was inspired to pursue a profession in sports counseling by her own experiences as a hurdler on the UF track team.

“Athletes at this level a lot of times are developmentally delayed because they have been spending all of their time training,” she said. “They don’t have the same luxuries as everyone else does to date, go abroad, or even to study.”

Jenkins’ office, adorned with comfy couches and decorated with plush pillows, offers students a space to forget about 6 a.m. stadiums, vent about coaches, or discuss anything else that they are struggling with and could potentially be holding them back in their sport. She also meets with them on campus for better convenience.

“If [student athletes] have someone telling them what to do every moment of the day, managing their every minute, and they’re not having any opportunities to explore who they are and what they want,” she said, “then they need someone to step in an advocate for them.”

For Jenkins, it’s about the person, not the athletic performance.

“They’re not robots, they need permission to just be who they are,” she said. “Anybody who focuses on results or performances as the end all be all is really neglecting the whole process.”

UF employs full time nutritionists, strength coaches, athletic trainers, and doctors to work one-on-one with athletes in all 13 sports – but not a sports counselor. While affiliated with the school, Jenkins is only employed at UF as an independent contractor. In other words, the university could drop her at any moment with no strings attached. As a result, job security serves as her biggest challenge. 

Nicole Noyes, a PhD student at Indiana University Bloomington, believes the answer lies in the stigma attached to the title of “counselor.”

“For a domain that prides itself on toughness, addressing mental health is often seen as grounds for failure or weakness,” she said. “On the contrary, de-stigmatizing mental illness may actually lead to better performance outcomes and greater resources for athletes.”

The psychological tolls elite athletes undergo are rising, and the headlines are reflecting that. Sasha Menu Courey, a swimmer at the University of Missouri, and Madison Holleran, a distance runner at Penn, recently committed suicide, shattering hearts around the country. (* I found this quote from an espn news article that I thought would fit in really well here: “According to the most recent data compiled by the NCAA, suicide was the third-leading cause of death of student-athletes from 2004-08, after accidents and cardiac causes” but I’m not sure how to phrase it while still giving credit to espn. I tried researching the stat myself on the ncaa website, but can’t find it. Any ideas?)

“[Holleran’s death] really hit home for many of us, because if we did not see ourselves in her shoes, we have close friends who we know felt her same pressures,” said Steel, who graduated Penn the year after Holleran had started her freshman year. “What I hope the younger members of the team can hear is no matter what fight you are fighting, you do not have to fight alone.”

Steel said that her doctor, nutritionist and counselor were the support system that saved her life, and if a school does have these resources, more athletes should take advantage of them. Noyes, who competed in crew at Holy Cross University, also wished she had support resources to help her through her four years as a collegiate student-athlete.

“Sport psychology consultants can make it a point to promote services to coaches and teams,” Noyes said. “But coaching staff and administration need to be willing to actively support and promote this access.”

For Christine Moore, being mentally strong is the backbone to not just her individual athletic success, but for overall team success. As a freshman computer science major from Oklahoma, when Moore, 19, isn’t cramming for her next calculus exam, she’s spiking setting on a UF’s sandy beach volleyball court. Having once been a pressure-driven elite high school player, she now chooses to see the sport as fun rather than solely a competition.

“If I messed up once, I would just shrink into a shell and never come back out and then from there on out I would think everything I did was bad,” she said. “My intensity came off as being rude, and I lost favor in a lot of my teammates’ eyes.” 

Moore looks back at this attitude and calls it her “old self.” And while she’s overcome many mental struggles on the court, they often have a knack for reemerging – something she experienced over spring break while playing a friendly tournament with her boyfriend.

“I wanted to impress him, and I put so much pressure on myself… It really scared me because it showed me that if you stop being mentally tough for just one second, everything can just flood back,” she said.

The pressure to be perfect in every play was something instilled in her by her first coach in eighth grade, who verbally tore her down after every missed pass or set.

“I went home everyday after practice crying,” she said. “It kind of killed my self-esteem and it wasn’t just in the sports aspect, but overall as a person.”

To combat her old-self and overcoming in-game perfectionism, she relied heavily on the support of others. The words of her father, which helped her move on after her first middle school coach, often echo in her ears: “Work hard and prove her wrong.” And when her high school coach asked her why she put so much pressure on herself if she was doing her best, Moore just shook her head.

“I don’t know why, but that just clicked for some reason,” she said. “When you have coaches yelling at you or frustrations between teammates, the most important thing you can do and the best thing you can do to win is to keep your mental game strong, and I think that’s more important than being physically strong.”

Had she chosen to pursue playing at the collegiate level, she definitely would have used any sports counseling resources available. She looks up to volleyball Olympians like Misty-May and Kerri Walsh-Jennings who undergo neurofeedback training in order to combat their own psychological setbacks.

“Its the third day of the tournament, you’re exhausted and you know you don’t have anything; It comes down to how badly you want it and how deep you’re gonna push,” she said. “I think its then that you really find out how mentally tough you are.”

(Interviewing Jenkins again on neuro/biofeedback training for UF athletes and possibly interviewing a UF athlete who has done it)

Steel has never done biofeedback and may never have to. Right now, she’s just enjoying the ride. Two years out of Penn, and she’s lacing up her shoes for her daily runs with the Greater Philadelphia Track Club – preparing for the Boston Marathon in late April.

“[Running] is not the priority it used to be,” she said. “It’s really like a joy, and getting to go for a run is the highlight of my day.” 

I was planning on the ending the story with a follow-up interview after Boston (April 21), but I’m not sure if that is too late? Do we know when final stories need to be submitted?
