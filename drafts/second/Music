Music makes the people come together, Madonna sang.
Rihanna doesn’t want us to stop it, white boys play it funky and the hills were alive with the sound of it.
For college students across Gainesville, music provides an escape from, a soundtrack to and a major part of their lives.
Every day, thousands of students walk up Newell Road, through Turlington Plaza and across the Reitz Union lawn with headphones in ear. Some are the bulky, over-the-ear, cost-$300-of-my-parents-money variety. Others are the frayed, frazzled, why-would-I-buy-headphones-when-they-come-with-my-phone type.
And all of them are blaring different types of music directly into our ears. 
Justin Bieber, Iron Maiden, or Ludwig van Beethoven — whatever is coming through your speakers affects your mood and how you think.
For Lorena Marerro, a 21-year-old psychology major at UF, music helps her get through her running.
Marerro completed the Trail of Payne 10 K on March 29. During the race, she said she tried to match the tempo of the songs she listened to with how fast she was running.
“Like 180 beats per minute, because that’s what we’re trying to have as our stride,” she said. “Long distance, Beyonce, she’s great.”
Another competitor at Trail of Payne was Nick Johns, a 22-year-old biology major at UF.
Johns decided to take a different approach to his run, opting for country and rock music instead of hip-hop.
“It was really soothing,” Johns said. “It just helped me coast and get my mind off running.”
However, music doesn’t just help people get through their exercise. It can help people get through some of the toughest times.
Daniel Bowen, a 19-year-old history major, doesn’t just listen to contemporary music. His favorite genre dates back hundreds of years, and his taste for classical music is attributable to one person — his late grandfather.
Bowen said his grandfather, Alex Panamá, composed music after he retired and introduced him to the music at a young age. He said Panamá went to Julliard and lived in Paris while studying under famous composers Juliette Nadia Boulanger and Pierre Boulez.
But Panamá spent much of his life managing a cable company in El Salvador, and music became something he did in his free time.
“He took his musical life kind of as a side hobby,” Bowen said. “It wasn’t until maybe about 10 years before he died that he started really composing full time because he was retired by then.He made concertos, symphonies, sonatas, the works.”
Later in his life, Panamá shared his love of classical music with Bowen, sitting down to watch and listen to videos and CDs of classical performances.
“He’d be like, ‘Go up, pick one, and we can watch it or listen to it,’” Bowen said. “It would just be him and me chilling out on the sofa. It was those memories that whenever I listen to Beethoven’s Fifth or any Wagner overture, it’s like my grandpa’s there with me.”
When Panamá died in September 2010, Bowen said the music Panamá introduced him to helped him cope with his grandfather’s death.
“I would stay in my room and listen to a bunch of sad symphonies,” he said. “Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7, Wagner’s Funeral March, Chopin’s sonatas, stuff like that. It really brought memories of him back, but it also showed me that this is what my grandfather’s left me."
Now, classical music is Bowen’s lifeline. He listens to it when he’s happy. He listens to it when he’s sad. He listens to it when he just wants to relax.
“It all depends on what kind of mood I’m in,” he said. “If I’m happy, I’m going to listen to probably some Beethoven, some symphony, or maybe a (Franz) Schubert sonata or a (Johann) Strauss waltz. If I’m sad, I’m going to listen to maybe some Wagner overtures or some Tchaikovsky symphonies.”
Bowen said he has a pair of noise-canceling headphones that he likes to use when he relaxes and listens to music. He uses them primarily for classical music, saying that contemporary pop music is fine when he’s listening to the radio or doing housework.
But when he wants to actually listen to music, it’s classical all the way.
“Classical music for me is more calm but yet more intense,” he said. “Contemporary music is just music for me. It’s something that I sing along to on the radio or I have playing in the background … But it’s not something I actually sit down and exert energy listening to.”
 
“It’s really gotten me through a lot of difficult times in my life,” he said. “But it’s also propelled me and motivated me at times when I’m at my peak.”
