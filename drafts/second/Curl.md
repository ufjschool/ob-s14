	On the morning of January 3, 2012, Athena Papadopoulos laced up her running shoes, on Jacksonville Beach, and prepared herself for her run. She wasn’t the only one on the beach that morning who would be running, but she was the only one who planned to run 2,460 miles.
	The 21-year-old runner spent a year in Kenya on a mission trip and came home to America feeling a little lost. 	
	“When I got back to America the memories of Kenya and of the people I met really stuck with me,” Papadopoulos said. “When I was there I felt like I was helping out, but once I got back home I felt like I couldn’t do anything more for them.”
	She soon began formulating an idea of how she could help the people she had grown to love in Kenya. She decided that she would run from Jacksonville, Fla to San Diego, Calif and raise money and awareness for clean drinking water for people in Kenya. 
	The trip would inevitability take her five and a half months to complete, or 163 days, and she ended up raising about $19,000. The run across America had been a success, but that didn’t mean that is was easy. 
	Papadopoulos left for her run with only a route mapped out and her stroller that she dubbed Wilson. Wilson would carry things like water and clothes for her. She would run during the day and then stop in a town hoping to find a place to stay.
	Her first stop would always be the Baptist Church where she would tell the congregation her mission and hope for support.  Papadopoulos said that she was always amazed at the generosity and kindness of others.
	“During the beginning of my trip Wilson kept having tire issues and someone bought me new tires for him,” she said. “Countless people also bought me new running shoes over the course of my run.”
	Most nights she had a warm place to stay, but there were occasions when she had to pitch a tent on the side of the road.
	“It was kind of scary,” she admitted. “It was also really hard to sleep with the sun coming up so early so I was really tired on those days.”
	As she continued on her journey the biggest surprise to her was that people decided to start tagging along.
	“ I would have people that would run five miles with me or run with me till I left their town,” she said. “It was so amazing.”
	The biggest shock yet, came when she made it to Mississippi and two women decided to run the rest of the journey with her. She said that having other people on the trip definitely made things much more enjoyable.
	With only about a month left in her journey, disaster struck. All of the strain that she had been putting on herself from running led to a stress fracture in her foot. 
	She took a few days off from running and was feeling very disheartened at the time.  
	“The day I went to the doctor and he told me I had a stress fracture I was at an all time low,” she said, “ but then everyone who was following my journey was sending me their support and prayers and I just looked to God and I knew that I could finish.”
	After giving her foot the rest it deserved, Papadopoulos continued on her trek with a newfound determination. On day 163 when she finally made it to San Diego she was elated. 
	“I just remember running out onto the pier and just feeling so relieved that I had made it,” she said. 
	Papadopoulos insists that her will to finish came from God’s strength and the support from others.
	“When I told people what I wanted to do a lot of them looked at me like I was crazy,” she said. “ I mean, it is crazy, but I just knew that with God’s love and my determination I could do it.” 
	After running from coast to coast and raising awareness for clean water in Kenya, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Papadopoulos had wanted to take a break. Break doesn’t seem to be a word in her vocabulary though. She is now currently embarking on a trip that is called, The World Race.
	Her trip has taken her to eleven different countries in eleven months. She isn’t running this one, but who knows maybe one day she will decide to run across the world.
	“I don’t know about that,” she said. “After I made it to California I couldn’t wait to see what was in store for me next, so I’ll just say maybe on running around the world.”
