#The Mischievous Madams Bring Sexy Back to Gainesville

Warm, dreamlike light permeates the stage. A sultry woman’s voice melds with jazz, leading the audience down a nostalgic road to a time of martinis and cinched waists. A raven-haired beauty from another world floats onstage in a button-down red dress, her bright eyes ready to capture the imaginations of the crowd. Before long, she’ll have them in the palm of her hand.

A burlesque performer whose stage name is Stella O’Hare removes her intricate costume slowly and deliberately, piece by piece. First her delicate black gloves, then her broad-skirted dress, revealing a bright red corset. She takes her cues from the audience, who cheer and beckon at her insistence; she won’t take it off unless they tell her to.

Down to lacey red and black lingerie, she conceals her body with large white feathered fans. A carefully choreographed dance teases the audience with glimpses of a thigh or waist. She connects with her audience, looking them in the eyes and hanging her every move on their cheers until the crowd is frenzied.

The song crescendos as the moment everyone’s been waiting for arrives. She shows (almost) all in a pair of heart-shaped pasties and a sparkling thong. For O’Hare, however, the end result is the least important part of the performance.

“People who don’t understand it will say ‘Oh, you’re just taking your clothes off. You’re just stripping,’ but that’s not what burlesque has to be,” she said. “It’s not just like I’m just going to take off my clothes and grind in your face for tip money. We’re putting on a show, putting on a performance for their entertainment.”

O’Hare is one of seven women in the Mischievous Madams burlesque troupe, formed in April 2013 as the first burlesque-only troupe in Gainesville by manager Stephen Tierney and founding members Aurora Bootyalis and Whiskey Chase. With shows on average every month, the Madams bring this classic style of performance to the community and have fun doing it.

“We want to give Gainesville a good representation of what burlesque is and can be,” O’Hare said.

Derived from an Italian word meaning joke or mockery, burlesque appeared in Victorian Europe as parodies of well-known plays and operas performed by scantily-clad women. American burlesque became popular in the early 20th century, combining elements of Victorian burlesque, minstrel shows and musical halls, eventually evolving to focus mainly on female strip tease. After experiencing a decline in popularity by the 1970s, a new generation inspired by the glamour and spectacle of the past have revived it in the last 20 years as a liberating form of self-expression for a mainly female audience.

“None of us are doing this for anyone else,” said one Mischievous Madam, who goes by Della Darling. "I feel like I can do anything. You’re totally vulnerable onstage, but you’re also controlling what happens”

The concept of the act is at the discretion of the performer and can be anything she wants, from dance-focused to scary or funny. The only blond in the troupe, Jenny Castle is another Mischievous Madam who prefers acts that have comedic elements or shock value, like when she shot sparks off her metal panties during March's rock-themed show or danced in character as the grandfather of one of the other performers in the troupe's one-year-anniversary show on April 12.

"I used to always think I needed to be so good, but now I realize I really enjoy being funny. I’ve gotten into clowning and comedy, and I realized I enjoy that more and have a talent for that," Castle said. "We all do something different."

Another performer who goes by Maressa Fox is one of the Madams and founder of the Manic Menagerie Vaudeville Company, which features classic burlesque as well as other variety show acts. Since she began pursuing a career as a professional burlesque performer and entertainment manager, she has improved her craft by following a key piece of advice she got from male burlesque performer Paco Fish:

“When an audience comes to a burlesque show they want one thing, and that’s not tits, it’s not ass. They want to get to know you,” Fox said.

A tall, slender red head, Fox loves the art form for its therapeutic effects on her body image since she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The disease is extremely painful, inhibiting her movement and causing her to feel like she has a sunburn and sore muscles. Getting onstage and hearing the audience cheer for her body grants her a reprieve, even if for a few minutes.

“I’m not very fond of my body in general because when it’s the cause of most of your problems you don’t tend to like it very much, but burlesque is all a celebration of your body,” Fox said. “People are cheering for your body and celebrating you because they think you’re beautiful. That’s really important to me. It’s like a very, very temporary escape from feeling like I’m trapped in the cage of my body.”

Another Mischievous Madam whose stage name is Lillie de Luna also found peace with her physical form when burlesque came into her life as the mother of a 3-year-old. 

“Having a baby changes the way you feel about your body,” she said. “It has affected me a lot with my body image issues because this troupe especially has a pretty wide variety of ladies.”

Burlesque has a reputation for embracing many body shapes, sizes and ages, like curvy Texas performer Ginger Snaps or the legendary redhead Tempest Storm, who is now 86 and was still performing in the 21st century. Being a great performer is a matter of charisma, not physical perfection.

Other troupe members would describe themselves as shy by nature but come out of their shell when they’re performing. O’Hare, for instance, has no problem dancing in minimal clothing in front of a crowd of people but would never sing karaoke alone.

“It’s like I’m a completely different person when I get onstage,” she said. “Up until the very last second when I get onstage I’m freaking out, but when we get onstage and everyone cheers it’s this adrenaline rush that’s like nothing else.”

With a gothic style that melds beauty with darkness, another performer who goes by the name of Formaldehyde Flower brands herself as Gainesville’s "spooky sweetheart.” She was drawn to burlesque not only as a performance style accepting of all kinds of women but also as a good way for an introvert to meet new people.

Offstage, Flower works remotely from home doing data entry and analysis and had never done any kind of performing before discovering burlesque. Her acts are designed to take the audience out of mundane reality with characters like a witch doctor and the Cheshire Cat.

“When I put together an act, what I’m doing is creating a temporary world for myself and my audience," Flower said. "We exist somewhere else. This is not real life anymore."

What the audience may not realize is the most important part of the strip tease is the intricate costuming. The Madams cultivate a do-it-yourself culture by making costumes together at a “stitch and bitch,” where they meet at someone’s house with their rind stones, hot glue and maybe some wine to work on their outfit for the next show and talk about what’s happening in their lives.

They repurpose old shoes and lingerie and turn household items into props by “bedazzling” them. Classic burlesque performances are full of sparkle, which makes it no wonder that Swarovski named burlesque icon Dita Von Teese its worldwide brand ambassador in 2007. Costumes can get expensive quickly if a performer doesn’t use at least some home-made pieces.

“The quote in the industry is ‘the difference between strip club stripping and burlesque is in strip club stripping you’re making $300 in a $30 outfit while in burlesque you’re making $30 in a $300 outfit,'” Flower said.

Like conceptualizing the act, however, creating the costumes is a labor of love for the Madams. While they may get different things out of performing, each Mischievous Madam has had her life changed for the better by discovering burlesque. Bravely completing a strip tease for an audience of friends and strangers has given each of them a boost of confidence and a chance to connect with themselves as well as the audience.

"(The acts) are all small parts of me I don’t express outwardly," said Mischievous Madam Sally Sucre. "I am kind of shy, so it’s not typical for me to just kind of take off my clothes in front of people I don’t know. The first time I did it, it was just so empowering and enthralling that I didn’t even care how many people were there or how many people weren’t."
