#The Mischievous Madams

Warm, dreamlike red light permeates the stage. A sultry woman’s voice melds with jazz, leading the audience down a nostalgic road to a time of martinis and cinched waists. A raven-haired beauty in a polka dot dress floats onstage bright-eyed and animated, ready to capture the imaginations of the crowd. Before long, she’ll have them in the palm of her hand.

The burlesque performer whose stage name is Stella O’Hare removes her intricate costume slowly and deliberately, piece by piece. First her 50s-era hat and gloves, then her broad-skirted dress, revealing a bright red corset. She takes her cues from the audience, who cheer and beckon at her insistence; she won’t take it off unless they tell her to.

Down to lacey black lingerie, she conceals her body with large white feathered fans. A carefully choreographed dance teases the audience with glimpses of a thigh or waist. She connects with her audience, looking them in the eyes and hanging her every move on their cheers until the crowd is frenzied.

The song crescendos as the moment everyone’s been waiting for arrives. She shows (almost) all in a pair of heart-shaped pasties and a sparkling thong. For O’Hare, however, the end result is the least important part of the performance.

“People who don’t understand it will say ‘Oh, you’re just taking your clothes off. You’re just stripping,’ but that’s not what burlesque has to be,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be strip tease, but even if it is a strip tease it’s more about the whole act of it. It’s not just like oh I’m just going to take off my clothes and grind in your face for tip money. We’re putting on a show, putting on a performance for their entertainment.”

O’Hare is one of seven women in the Mischievous Madams burlesque troupe, formed in April 2013 as the first burlesque-only troupe in Gainesville. Along with the Manic Menagerie Vaudeville Company, the Madams are bringing this old style of variety show to the community with shows on average every month.

“We want to give Gainesville a good representation of what burlesque is and can be,” O’Hare said.

Derived from an Italian word meaning joke or mockery, burlesque appeared in Victorian Europe as parodies of well-known plays and operas. American burlesque became popular in the early 20th century, combining elements of Victorian burlesque, minstrel shows and musical halls. The style of performance has seen a new wave of popularity since the 1990s and is not limited to strip tease but also includes comedy acts, performance art and satire.

Another performer who goes by Maressa Fox is one of the Madams and founder of the Manic Menagerie Vaudeville Company, which features burlesque as well as fire acts and live music. Since she began pursuing a career as a professional burlesque performer and entertainment manager, she has improved her craft by following a key piece of advice she received at a workshop with male burlesque performer Paco Fish:

“When an audience comes to a burlesque show they want one thing, and that’s not tits, it’s not ass. They want to get to know you,” Fox said.

A tall, slender red head with classic burlesque style, Fox loves the art form for its therapeutic effects on her body image since she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The disease is extremely painful, causing her to constantly feel like she has a sunburn and sore muscles and not move very well at all. The appreciation the audience has for her body grants her reprieve from her condition, if even for just a few minutes.

“I’m not very fond of my body in general because when it’s the cause of most of your problems you don’t tend to like it very much, but burlesque is all a celebration of your body,” Fox said. “When I’m onstage, people get excited when my hand comes out of my glove, like, my hand is exciting. When my leg comes out of my skirt that’s exciting. When I don’t have anything on that’s exciting. People are cheering for your body and celebrating you because they think you’re beautiful. That’s really important to me. It’s like a very, very temporary escape from feeling like I’m trapped in the cage of my body.”

Another Mischievous Madam whose stage name is Lillie de Luna also found peace with her physical form when burlesque came into her life as the mother of a 3-year-old. 

“Having a baby changes the way you feel about your body,” she said. “It has affected me a lot with my body image issues because this troupe especially has a pretty wide variety of ladies.”

Burlesque has a reputation for embracing many body shapes, sizes and ages, like curvy icon ______ or and the legendary redhead Tempest Storm, who is now 86 and still performs every once and a while. Being a great performer is a matter of charisma, not physical perfection.

Other troupe members would describe themselves as shy by nature but come out of their shell when they’re performing. O’Hare, for instance, has no problem dancing in minimal clothing in front of a crowd of people but would never sing karaoke alone.

“It’s like I’m a completely different person when I get onstage,” she said. “Up until the very last second when I get onstage I’m freaking out, but when we get onstage and everyone cheers it’s this adrenaline rush that’s like nothing else.”

With a gothic style that melds beauty with darkness, another performer who goes by the name of Formaldehyde Flower brands herself as “Gainesville’s very own late-blooming spooky sweetheart.” She was drawn to it not only as a performance style accepting of all kinds of women, but also as a good way for an introvert to meet new people.

In real life, Flower works remotely from home doing data entry and analysis and had never done any kind of performing before discovering burlesque. Flower creates her acts to give the audience a reprieve from mundane reality with characters from a witch doctor to the Cheshire Cat.

“When I put together an act, what I’m doing is creating a temporary world for myself and my audience. We exist somewhere else. This is not real life anymore,” Flower said.

It may seem ironic that in a strip tease, the most important part of the act is the costume. The Madams as a troupe cultivate a do-it-yourself culture by making their costumes together at the weekly “stitch and bitch,” where people meet at someone’s house with their rind stones, hot glue and maybe some wine to work on their outfit for the next show and talk about what’s happening in their lives. 

They repurpose old shoes and lingerie and turn household items into props by “bedazzling” them, a labor of love for the Madams. Classic burlesque performances are full of sparkle, which makes it no wonder that Swarovski named burlesque icon Dita Von Teese its worldwide brand ambassador since 2007. Costumes can get expensive quickly if a performer doesn’t use at least some home-made pieces.

“The quote in the industry is ‘the difference between strip club stripping and burlesque is in strip club stripping you’re making $300 in a $30 outfit, while in burlesque you’re making $30 in a $300 outfit,” Flower said.

The only blonde in the troupe, another Mischievous Madam whose stage name is Jenny Castle loves burlesque because it allows her to break out her massive collection of costumes she has made over the years. She learned a passion for sewing from her mother.

“I’ve got an attic with literally 30 tubs of costumes that I’ve made over the years,” Castle said.
