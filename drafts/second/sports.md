##MEN'S BASKETBALL 

When the Gators took on the Kentucky Wildcats at Rupp Arena on February 15, ESPN displayed before-and-after pictures of UF seniors Will Yeguete, Casey Prather and Patric Young. Each looked more pumped up than the next, with muscles so defined, you'd think (Michelangelo sculpted them himself/ you were looking at a picture in an anatomy textbook). Those three men who 
were once lanky and looked like your average teenager about to play basketball at the neighborhood court are now some of the strongest in the nation for college men’s basketball. All are a product of Preston Greene’s training programs. 

Greene has been the team’s strength and conditioning coordinator for three seasons. Every day, year round, he’s with the team making them stronger, more flexible and faster than the day they were recruited. He’s the guy on the court before the game stretching the players out who all the girls in the stands wish they could be. Of all the individuals who help contribute to the performance of a UF men’s basketball player, Greene is, literally, the most hands on. 

Yeguete said Greene’s impact on the team is huge and you can see it during games — not just by watching how the Gators move on the court. 

“We play against teams that can’t keep up with us because we are better conditioned than they are," the athlete said. "I think that’s a credit to Preston.” 

Preston's effect on the team begins on day one: when incoming freshmen enroll for Summer B. Throughout voluntary off-season training sessions, Greene begins to evaluate each player and creates a personal program for each player to fix what he calls their “weak link.” 

The Clemson alum compares the process to that of getting your car aligned. Just as you let go of your steering wheel to see what direction your car goes in, basketball players are the same way in the way they move on the court and in the weight room. 

"Guys may be quicker to their right than they are to their left," Greene explained. "They may be tighter in one muscle than another one that works synergistically with the other. They may be stronger in one part of the body versus another part of the body. Those ratios change throughout the season just because of the way they move, the way they play, injuries." 

After a head-to-toe breakdown on each guy of their tightest and weakest spots, Greene prescribes certain exercises, movements, sets and reps to align each player's steering wheel. 

It's basically like having a really awesome personal trainer at their disposal. 

“I always tell them, ‘Hey! When you leave here, you’ll be paying some idiot a hundred dollars to do this, so you might as well take advantage of it now,’” Greened jested. 

Yeguete laps it up. 

"I learned so much more about my body: stretching, how the stretching works, eating well," the 22-year-old expressed. "Preston knows a lot about the body, and he's good about sharing those things with us. He gives us a lot of advice about preparing our bodies for each season." 

And with each season, the training program is altered as the players grow and improve. After the season is over, Greene meets with Head Coach Billy Donovan and the coaching staff to set goals for each player. Optimal body weights are their focus. 

“I want my guys to be very,very lean,” Greene stressed, “because the leaner or less body fat they have, for basketball, the quicker they are and the higher they can jump. If a guy has, in my opinion, a higher body fat than I would like, then I will determine his body weight off of that. Or if a guy is already lean and he’s at the weight that I want." 

When Yeguete started at UF in 2010, a different strength and conditioning coordinator was on staff. Then when Greene started, the 6-foot-7 forward suffered injury after injury: concussions, a broken foot, and knee problems. Last year, he underwent several arthroscopic surgeries to remove bone chips in his right knee. Once healthy and ready to hit the court again, Yeguete had to revamp his body for his final year with the team. 

“My junior year, I was heavy — top heavy," he said. 

So Greene set a goal for Yeguete: to lose weight. 

“I was about 240 at the start of the season," Yeguete noted. "and now I’m at 223. My goal was to be 222, so I went down, like, 15 pounds. That just shows how Preston works." 

It doesn't just work, it excels. Yeguete was starting forward this year, racking up almost 900 minutes this season and more than 190 rebounds. 

With the Gators having one of the best seasons in the team's history, Greene is ecstatic. His positive energy is a staple for the team, though — win or lose. 

“One way I’ve been successful is I’m very, very energetic and very passionate about what we do," he described, "so when my guys come in to train, they tend to feed off my energy. When they come in, I’m ready to go right off the bat.”

On the court, Yeguete feeds off his own passion. 

“Playing basketball here is really fun," he raved. "It’s been really, really fun being here. Being out there, having fun with my teammates — that’s what keeps me going — Just going out there and doing what I love to do. It’s fun going out there with them and just trying to get better and seeking greatness." 

And greatness is expected.  

“They know from day one that there is a certain level of expectation that needs to be met on the court," Greene revealed. “Coach Donovan tells these guys during the recruiting process and during their time here, we are going to work in this program. You’re not just going to show up and play games. You are going to practice every day. You are going to condition. You are going to lift weights. You are going to do all these things in order to be successful, and that’s kind of the values of our program. Our program is based on hard work. They get this message from everybody.” 

Everyone includes former Gator athletes who have gone on to play in the National Basketball Association -- guys like Joakim Noah, Bradley Beal and Chandler Parsons. 

"They see these guys come back and work and that really hits home with our young guys," Greene noted. "It’s like, ‘Hey! OK, these guys are not just talented. They work to be successful.’” 

For the freshman, the seniors spread the message, set a good example and amp up the energy. 

“We have to lead the team," Yeguete stressed. "We have to be ready to go every single day, and we have to make sure they’re ready to go every single day, so we have to bring it."

##WOMEN'S TRACK

Looking at the European snow-capped mountains for the last time, Agata Strausa knew she was going to need much more than coffee and her favorite dark chocolate to get her through this trip.

Two years ago, Strausa, now 24, chose to leave behind her Latvian family and her career in product design at the Berlin Academy of Arts to pursue her dream to become a professional distance-runner.

“When I saw the plane take off, it was very strange,” she said. “I thought how within a minute a life can totally change and how blessed I was to have this opportunity to start as somebody else, somewhere else.”

Trying to relax on the ten-hour flight to Gainesville, she closed her eyes and counted the upcoming days: One day until she’d be in another country. Ten days until she’d walk into her first UF art history class. And 30 until she’d lace up her spikes, slip on her orange and blue jersey and compete for the first time as a UF mid-distance track runner. 

“Energy is more in the mind than in the body,” she said. “It’s not so much about how you fuel yourself and your body but more like how your attitude is.”

Strausa was pretty much born motivated. Determined to balance both athletics and academics, she spent nearly three hours a day commuting from the Berlin Academy of Arts to the other side of the city for her team practices. Pulling all-nighters and having to squeeze in extra studio hours on the weekend, she was sick of being torn, and transferred to UF for her final two years of undergraduate study.

“German universities don’t know a collegiate competitive athletic program, so academics and athletics were separated with little understanding of each other,” she said. “I had to beg professors to excuse my absence if I had to compete somewhere.”

Only adding to her troubles, the German Athletic Association had forbidden Strausa’s coach, Beate Conrad (German national coach of women’s distance running and former Olympian) to continue coaching Strausa since she was technically a citizen of Latvia and therefore a potential competitor to Germany. 

“Without a coach or a support system, I couldn’t make my dream to be an elite runner come true,” she said.

But at UF, not only would Strausa be able to be committed to both her studies and to her athletics, but she would also have the full support of a coach and a group of teammates her own age practically right outside her doorstep.

“My roommates, who were also my teammates, made it really easy for me,” she said. “They were my energy.”

Callie Cooper, 23, a four-year UF distance runner and 2013 graduate, was a guide and mentor for Strausa. As an organic-crop production major and former vegan, Cooper had fully embraced Gainesville’s agricultural corners. Trader Joe’s excursions, Wednesday Farmer’s Market runs and organic pre-run breakfasts had quickly become the heart of “The Coop,” the name of Cooper and Strausa’s four bedroom home which they shared with two other girls.

“It was a little tough at first because we were strangers and everything was so new to her,” Cooper said, who now resides in Eugene, Oregon and runs for Team Eugene running club. “It was awesome to be able to travel all over the states together for meets, and she came home with me for a couple of Thanksgivings.”

But the excitement of living in this Florida farm town of Gainesville, studying at a new school and competing on a team three times the size of the one in Germany didn’t even compare to how she felt before her first indoor race. Only a month after moving in, Strausa debuted in the 3,000-meter race at the indoor University of Washington Husky Classic in Seattle. Stepping onto the track with some of the top collegiate distance runners in the country and professionals representing companies such as Nike and Adidas left her completely speechless.

“I didn’t even know what to say,” she said. “I just remember I was so pumped and excited and energized the first time I put the Florida jersey on to compete. That was a special moment for me.”

Staying focused on the race and getting to the starting line on time, Strausa remembers stepping out of her warm-up clothes a little too early. UF head track and field coach, Mike Holloway, was by her side with compassion, advice, and some pre-race encouragement.

“It meant that my head coach really cares about me and has, like, his eyes on us all of the time,” she said. “He takes his job really seriously and takes what we do really seriously.”

With her coaches and teammates cheering on the sidelines, she let the orange and blue energy cruise her to the finish line, running a personal best of 9:17. After that, she knew UF had been the right choice. Fast-forward two years, and that same energy is far from depleted. 

“Every athlete is just as good as his support system,” she said. “It's not just about the athlete’s performance, it's about how the people that perform that stand behind the athlete.”

Andy Klock, head UF track and field athletic trainer, is one big part of Strausa’s success. Spending up to 70 hours a week with the team in season, Klock enjoys helping the athletes reach their potential not just in their sport, but in life.

“We constantly try to maintain a very positive atmosphere in the athletic training room,” he said. “One technique I utilize as well is reminding the athlete that the only person they are competing with is themselves.”

Much of Strausa’s schedule revolves around working with her trainers in injury prevention, working with a nutritionist in creating meal plans and working with a weight coach in strength training. But at the end of the day, her energy and motivation always comes back to her teammates.

Together, they pound out lap after lap in the Florida sun on UF’s orange and blue track. Together, they wake up on Saturdays at 6 a.m. for 90-minute long runs at Micanopy. Together, they pass off a baton during a distance medley relay, to place fourth at the 2014 indoor national meet. 

“It’s about going through something together with someone and sharing joy and pain,” Strausa said. “It’s always easier when they’re around.”

Graduating in May, Strausa has led her own gator legacy. And while her two-year life in Gainesville was never easy, its challenges have changed the way she lives everyday. 

“What takes most energy for me is to overthink things, judge oneself and not forgive mistakes,” she said. “I’ve learned that it is ok to have crappy races, miserable moods and pizza or chocolate...It’s about what you do the next day, what consequences you take for yourself to be a better person in the future.”

##MEN'S SWIMMING

*I have not done any further reporting since first drafts because swimming is still at nationals - no changes have been made since Amber's edits*

It’s 5:30 am when the bright lights of the O’Connell Center Indoor Pool switch on and the 50 members of the swim team trickle in. Tommy Stitch, head athletic trainer for the team, spends his time filling orange Gatorade tubs, treating flu-season colds, and waits for the sun to rise and a new day to begin.

“There is no typical day for me,” Stitch said.

After a two-hour practice, he heads right over to the weight room where the team holds an hour-long strength and conditioning session. His day follows up with an afternoon practice, post-practice treatments and rehabilitation. Tot to mention appointment scheduling, paperwork and staff meetings. Throw away swim meets into the mix and you have a near 24/7 job.

“Its so easy to take care of people at UF. We have so many resources,” he said. “And if you can’t figure something out, there’s always a bunch of other people that can. We’re all working together.”

Studying exercise science at Fresno State and LSU, Stitch has worked with volleyball, lacrosse and tennis. It wasn’t until he ventured to the Swamp where he found his true training rhythm in swimming.

“Swimmers are disciplined,” he said. “It’s humbling to be around people that are so focused on what they do everyday – it makes you better.”

Competing most years from September through April, swimming at UF is considered a year-long sport. With the constant get-up-and-go energy among swimming phenomena, Stitch pays special attention to maintaining each individual athlete’s energy.

“There are some days where they all just looked drained,” Stitch said. “We just communicate: Every day, all day, communicating about everybody. I think a lot of people kind of feed off that.”

Matt Thompson, 21, IM(? **what is this?) and freestyle and sports management junior, sure does.

“With the training program, you can overwork things. If you’re not feeling well and you’re having a bad practice and you just don’t speak up about it, it can look like you’re just not trying,” he said. “Communication is definitely the biggest thing.”

For Thompson, its crucial for athletes to be proactive in making time in their schedules to see both the trainers and coaches, especially when something is hurting.

“The biggest injury would be shoulders,” said Stitch. “They can just point to where their shoulder hurts and we just already know what it is.”

To combat the wear and tear of swimming on the body, the team engages in daily weight room preventative exercises, fuels with Gatorade Prime Chews and carbohydrate powder, Vitargo, and focuses on hydrating throughout the day.

“People probably don’t think about it with swimmers, but they sweat in the water so they don’t see it.” Stitch said. “It’s a little bit dangerous compared to other sports.”

The sports nutrition office and weight room also also offer a variety of ways to energize the swim team. Post weight sessions call for Protein bars and shakes while snacks such as mixed nuts line shelves and a rainbow of Gatorade stocks the nutrition office fridge. But energy intake doesn’t stop at food and water.

“Our sport is so demanding, that it has to be a lifestyle in order to be successful,” Thompson said. “ You really want to make sure you get a good nights sleep.”

-INTERVEWING THOMSPON AGAIN ON A SPECIFIC MEET MEMORY/EXPEREIENCE WHERE THEY PLAYED “SHABBA”-

Traveling across the country to states like Texas, Minnesota and schools throughout the SEC is one of Thompson’s favorite parts of being a gator swimmer. In the locker room before his meet in ____, one of the seniors cranked up the sterero.

“Shabba” by A$ap Ferg blasted the speakers

“It’s this year’s go-to song,” Thompson said. “When we hear that, we get pretty amped.”
