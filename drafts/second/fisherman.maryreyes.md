Part I: The Man
Beneath the “Parental Advisory” beanie and the rough, black hoodie, the 4 a.m. shadows conceal his coon-eye tan. Andrew Balasis turns the radio dial, drowning out the eerie silence that echoes through the nearly empty streets. The 23-year-old commercial fisherman rises before dawn most days, chasing the horizon in pursuit of fish. He has a feeling today’s trip will be futile. 
“The front came through faster than predicted, and they don’t like that shit to swing to the north too quick,” he says, commenting on the unexpected cold front.
With mackerel season almost over, his chances of making a good catch are slim anyway. After paying for gas, he will most likely lose money on today’s venture.  
Transition
 “If I had to describe him in one word, I’d say he’s a badass,” said Luis Muniz, Andrew’s friend of nearly 10 years. “He’s the hardest worker I know.” 
The two met when Luis, who lived in the same development, wandered over to his street. When he first saw Andrew playing outside with his stepbrother, Alex, he thought Andrew was younger and initiated conversation with Alex first. He later discovered that Andrew is actually six years Alex’s senior and one year his own, but his height gave him a youthful appearance. Once he realized they were the same age, they became fast friends.
Since the beginning of their friendship, the two wreaked havoc without even trying. One of Luis’ earlier memories of Andrew happened when their neighbor and mutual friend, Scott, cleaned out his pool filter. Scott took off the filter’s grate, leaving a powerful, gaping hole at the bottom of the pool. A dare led Andrew to swim down and place his rear end over it. Apparently, he underestimated its strength.
“We had to jump in the pool,” recalled Luis. “Scott and I had to grab him by his arms and pull as hard as we could, and he had a giant hickey on his ass.”
To elaborate on the size of the massive welt it left behind – no pun intended – Scott  added, “His ass had what looked like the world’s largest hickey, like a one foot diameter circle.” 
Anyone who knows Andrew thinks nothing of that story. A natural daredevil, he boasts quite of few astonishing tales, and being a fisherman only adds to the adventure. 

Part II: The Profession
A typical day begins before sunrise. Once the alarm goes off, there’s no time to waste. To be a fisherman, one cannot be overly fond of sleep. Andrew usually blasts music on the 15-minute ride from his home in Palm Beach Gardens to Jupiter, where he keeps his boat, Miss Ellie. Lana del Ray keeps him company on the journey. He nods his head to the music, matching the slightly melancholy pace of “Radio,” one of his favorite songs. Then a more upbeat song blares from the speakers, drowning out any remnants of sleep still lingering in the air. The day has officially commenced.   
Once he arrives at the storage yard, it’s time to hitch Miss Ellie to the back of his pickup truck. Today, he makes idle conversation with his new audience. 
	“Why does my left hand work better? It should be my right hand when I’m right handed,” he observes as he cranks the handle. 
Most days, he works in solitude, the squeaking of the handle responding to his unuttered thoughts before he jumps back into the truck and drives away. 
Andrew needs fuel at the next stop, for Miss Ellie and for himself.  Luckily, the gas station sits adjacent to a Dunkin’ Donuts. He fills up the tank, transfers his equipment from the truck to the boat in preparation for the day’s work, and picks up an orange Gatorade. The restaurant has just opened by the time he finishes. He orders a medium coffee and nothing more- just enough to give him a boost before heading to his final destination. 
At the ramp, he makes the transformation from man to fisherman, clipping on his overalls and pulling on his tough rubber boots. He jumps into the truck one last time – backing up, backing up, backing up – the boat and the water inch closer together, like two lovers expectantly awaiting a kiss, until they touch. Miss Ellie and the ocean reunite. 
He steers the boat slowly at first. The undisturbed surface of the water ripples as it approaches. But soon, he picks up speed. The fact that it’s mid-February means it’s almost the end of mackerel season. He makes the majority of his income in the winter, when he nets mackerel and mullet, so he needs to take advantage of this opportunity.    
“Fishin’ for a living isn’t a guaranteed paycheck every week, it’s usually feast or famine,” he says.  “Fishing is a seasonal trade, but the weather is your boss most of the time.” 
Once he’s ventured far enough from shore, he makes his first throw of the day, spinning 360 degrees. The net hits the water with a splash. Andrew uses microfilament webbing. He prefers microfilament to multifilament because its thin, sheet quality makes it nearly undetectable to fish. Each net possesses different characteristics based on the type of fish being targeted. For mackerel, the net should be _______________. 
The first catch seems sparse. Just a few mackerel scuffle between the gaps in the net. Andrew fishes relatively peacefully for a while, then an unexpected freeloader appears. A seven-foot shark tries to steal fish from the net and becomes ensnared, tearing the net to shreds as it fights to escape.  There goes one net. 
In addition to sharks, Andrew must compete with porpoises and pelicans. Both make appearances throughout the morning, circling the boat in an attempt to take home some mackerel for themselves. 
The sun gradually ascends, illuminating the recycle bin slowly filling with mackerel.

Final quote: “I won’t ever be able to do anything else. I’ll die a fisherman.”
