HEDS: 
That's the Spirit 
In Good Spirits

Dance Marathon at the University of Florida celebrated its 20th anniversary on April 12. Last year, fundraisers helped break the $1,000,000 fundraising threshold for the first time in school history, and the passion students feel for the Children’s Miracle Network has done nothing but grow.  
		
The event features miracle children, who are children that have battled life-threatening illnesses and have been or are still being treated at UF Health Shands Hospital, a Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. 

Throughout the event, miracle children join their families on stage to tell their stories to the dancers are fundraising for the Children’s Miracle Network. The miracle children and students who are involved in Dance Marathon form special bonds that inspire the students to keep raising money in order to make more miracles happen for sick children. 
		
For an event as big as DM at UF to take place, a multitude of time and energy has to be spent by participating students before and during the event. One group of students is so passionate, so caring and so wild about Dance Marathon that the individuals in the group are designated as Morale Captains.  Their job is to keep the dancers dancing and to make sure every person leaves the event more inspired than they were before it began. 

When considering the energy behind the morale team, one cannot ignore the passion of their overall chair and leader, Joelle Waksman. 
Waksman graduated from UF in Spring 2013, but her passion for the cause convinced her she was meant to stay another year in Gainesville to lead the DM at UF morale team and raise money for the children she had grown to love over her  four years at the university. 
		
To Waksman, a miracle child is “an incredible spirit who constantly gives us inspiration to keep driving forward and doing the best we can to make miracles happen.”

Members of the morale team, as well as other students involved in Dance Marathon, get their energy to keep pushing forward throughout the 26.2 hours from the inspiration of the miracle children.  
		
Upon meeting the morale team, one cannot question that a major source of energy that keeps team members going throughout the event is not only their passion for helping save the lives of children but also their love for each other. 
		
“The morale team meets once a week, and our meetings are incredible,” Waksman said. “We know how to get down to business but also spend time getting to know each other, bonding and doing fun activities to deepen our team connection.”
		
Members of the morale team begin exerting their energy toward the cause long before the event begins. After applying to become a member of the team, the team hosts various events throughout the school year to raise money for the cause. Members of the team also schedule hospital visits to spend time with the miracle children who inspire them every day. 
	
Everyone can spot the morale team throughout the 26.2-hour-event. They are the captains decked out in colorful, elaborate costumes planned out days — sometimes weeks — in advanced. Each year, they choreograph a line dance for the event. And when music for it starts playing every hour on the hour, dancers look to the team for motivation as they lead it. 
		
But, what keeps this team of student leaders energized? How can you find them at the end of the event with smiles on their faces just as big and wide as their smiles were when the event started? If you ask Soma Nwokolo, a UF Law student and third-year morale team member, the answer is simple. The morale team members motivate each other to keep their spirits high.  
		
“We fed off each others energy,” the 23-year-old said. “Every time we do the line dance, it recharges my energy, too. And every time you get to hear a story from a miracle child, that is another boost of energy to be reminded why we are doing this. At this point, having started my involvement with Dance Marathon six years ago, I have watched some of these kids grow up before my eyes and get sick and get better. So, it touches me more and more each year. That is the ultimate motivation.”
		
Originally not having been chosen to have a spot as a dancer in Dance Marathon her freshman year the UF, Nwokolo was devastated. 
		
“Getting a spot as a dancer was very competitive, and I originally wasn't chosen,” she said. “But fortunately, a spot opened up, and our delegates offered it to me because I had been really upset when I wasn't chosen the first time. All I knew going into the event was that we were raising money for Shands Hospital, and that it was a really fun, really big event and that all my friends would be there. Part of my desire to be involved was that I just didn't want to miss out on this big event that I had been hearing about for the past nine months. When I got to the event and got to hear from the miracle families and see the impact we were making, I was hooked.” 
		
And Nwokolo hasn’t stopped dancing since. But now, she dances as a morale captain. 
		
When the physical exhaustion kicks in and the overall morale begins to gradually decline, morale team members combat their exhaustion by having friends and family members bring them treats to keep their energy levels high. 
		
“Sour candy is my best friend always but especially during DM,” Missy Perez, 21, said. 
	 	
While the second-year captain can be found chowing down on her favorite sour candies, you can find Nwokolo sipping on a smoothie. The overall ambiance however is still enough to keep them both going. 
		
“I think that because I am around a lot of special people and because there is always something going on," she said. "That is really what keeps my energy up." 
		
Becoming a morale captain is not easy. When applying for a captain position for DM at UF, students are allowed to apply for up to three teams they would like to work with, but can only interview for two. About 140 people applied to be on the morale team this year, and few were chosen. Many team members have been on the team for years. Students must truly standout in order to be considered for a position on the morale team. Nwokolo remembers her first interview. 
		
“I was so nervous,” she said. “Everyone had told me that it was really difficult to be chosen as a morale captain because it was so competitive. Kristen Gillis interviewed me. I had met her once before, and she was one of those people that I didn't really know, but I was so in awe with because she had such a warm and big personality and was so involved. She was one of those people that I just wanted to be exactly like. But she is also one of those people that makes you feel like you are her best friend in the first two seconds you meet her.”
		
Nwokolo knew she had to stand out to be chosen as a team member. 
		
“At the end of the interview, she asked me what it meant to me to get rowdy," she said. "And I just stood up and blurted out the rowdy cheer we used to do at football games at my high school. I stood up and did cheerleader claps and weird hand movements and yelled in her face. I was never a cheerleader. I was almost embarrassed afterwards, but she was still smiling and that made me feel really good about the interview.”
		
Perez also showed her passion for Dance Marathon through her interview last year. 
		
“I wanted to do something different, so I creepily created a puzzle with a collage of all the current Morale Captains making silly faces and wrote "MORALE 2013!!!" across the collage,” she said. “Then I asked [previous overall chair] Angela to solve the puzzle as I quietly played "I Want You to Want Me" in the background. The catch, though, was that I had withheld a piece. A piece that contained my face on it — beautiful selfie, of course, and I told Angela it seemed the Morale 2013 puzzle and team was incomplete without that piece.”
		
When watching the morale team members throughout the event, it becomes obvious how their passion for Dance Marathon and love for each other keeps them motivated to motivate dancers throughout the event.
Perez said the bond between members is a Disney movie. 
		
“If I had to compare the bond of the morale team to something, I’d probably compare it to Lilo and Stitch’s bond,” she said. “Some serious "ohana." That’s pretty deep.” 
		
The deepness of that bond is what led Waksman to stay the extra year. 
		
“I believe a lot of what keeps us energized throughout the event is our pure passion and love for Dance Marathon and everyone involved,” Waksman said. “There’s honestly nothing more fun then spending a straight 26.2 hours with hundreds and hundreds of people that are all hanging out for the same reasons. As morale captains, the team spends the entire year planning the event, planning the theme hours we put on during the event and forming friendships that are culminated throughout the year. Morale becomes a huge family, and being together is honestly the best way to ensure we have enough energy throughout the event." 
		
Many different teams of captains are responsible for making DM at UF the event that it has become over the past 20 years. The hard work undergone by hundreds of students to make this event happen is something Waksman can attest to. But she, like the rest of the morale team, is responsible for maintaining the overall morale throughout the event. 
		
“Honestly, the word ‘morale’ to me hasn’t meant the dictionary definition in many years,” she said. “To me, “morale” is family. It’s a group of cooky, interesting, and extraordinary people whose passion, love and devotion to DM and each other is infectious. Morale is memories, laughs, tears, love and best friendship. Morale is figuring out who you are through the care and love of others. Morale is being the best version of yourself.”
