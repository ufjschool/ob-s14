Here's a fun fact: Florida state law does not require sexual health education to be [medically accurate](https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_SE.pdf).

That's not to say that everything you know about sex is wrong, but if you attended public school in Florida or in any of the other 26 states that care more about age appropriateness than facts, there might be a few gaps in your knowledge.

“I remembered in high school going to our sexual health fairs, which were basically like ‘Ripley’s Believe It or Not,’ with every up-close picture of an STI you could imagine, and no really, real information,” said Kylie Brianne, president of University of Florida’s Voices for Planned Parenthood. She attended Martin County High School in Stuart, Fla.

“The idea that that stuff they were telling me might have been wrong, and that might have been perfectly legal and okay, was super scary to me,” she said.

###A quick lesson in American history and poor decision-making: 

The scare tactics favored by many public school health programs (also known as the “don’t have sex or you’ll get pregnant and die” approach) have their roots in 1981, when the federal government under the Reagan administration threw its support behind abstinence-only-until-marriage education programs.

That governmental support developed into [three funding streams]( http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID=1340&nodeID=1): the Adolescent Family Life Act, the Community-Based Abstinence Education program and the Title V program. Between 1996 and 2007, over $1.5 billion was fed into abstinence-only education programs through federal and state matching funds. 

The first two funding streams were shut down in 2010, but Title V was renewed in March of that year, and the government allocated $50 million per year in mandatory funding for 2010-2014.

To get these funds, health programs had to comply with an [eight-point definition of abstinence education](http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/FL%20Report%20-%20Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20Sunshine%20State.pdf) developed by the federal government. Here's where you'll find those legally-mandated scare tactics. According to this definition, one of the required elements of an abstinence education program is teaching that “sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects.”

This is a downright lie.

According to Samantha Evans, health promotion specialist at GatorWell Health Promotion Services with about ten years of experience in sex education, healthy sexual activity in a setting where you're comfortable and not being coerced can have positive effects on the body and mind.

Among these are: 

• Increased libido – “The more frequently you have sex, the better sex feels,” Evans said. This increase in libido is especially helpful for women who are on hormonal contraception or who are in transition to menopause. 

• Calorie burning – “It’s not going to replace lifting weights or going to a yoga class, but there are studies that say you can burn five calories a minute,” Evans said. 

• Increased heart function and possibly the increased function of specific muscles depending on the vigor of the sex act, positions used and other factors 

• Lowered blood pressure 

• Lowered risk of heart attack and prostate cancer 

• Balanced hormone levels 

• Increased immune system function 

• Lowered stress and improved sleep

If abstinence is an individual’s choice, that’s not to say they should run out and start having sex or else they’ll get sick and die. Risks related to STIs, UTIs and pregnancy are a reality. But abstinence-only education does not arm adolescents with the knowledge to prevent those risks. 

Since 1981, much research has been done to prove that abstinence-only programs don’t work, including a congressionally commissioned evaluation of the Title V program in 2007, which found "no evidence" that the programs changed teens' sexual behavior or made them more likely to be abstinent. Other research has shown that abstinence-only programs might even be [deterring contraceptive use](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Teen-Sex-Ed.html) among sexually active teens. 

Exclusive focus on STIs in health education detracts from time spent discussing contraceptive options and other aspects of sex, such as hygiene, consent, sexuality and the basics of biology and anatomy. Comprehensive sex education programs could go a long way towards filling these gaps.

“The baseline of the comprehensive approach [to sex education] is that knowledge is power,” said Evans.

###The lasting effects of a lacking education

Many people respond to our educators' refusal to educate us about sex by doing their own research. And many of them are successful, but some only run into more myths and misconceptions thanks to well-meaning peers and unreliable sources on the Internet spreading misinformation.

Common myths Evans has encountered amongst students include the idea that using more than one condom at a time increases protection and that the hymen always tears the first time someone has sex. In reality, using two condoms at once makes it more likely that the condoms will break, and the hymen does not need to tear – just stretch. Sufficient preparation, patience and a little bit of lubricant can easily prevent pain and tearing, no matter how inexperienced an individual may be.

During her time with Voices for Planned Parenthood, Brianne has had similar experiences with undereducated students.
VOX's primary forms of outreach are tabling on campus and Condom Crawls, during which VOX members make small bags of condoms, lube and candy to hand out around midtown and downtown Gainesville on Friday nights. The group also gives out condoms at events on campus. On Valentine’s Day, the group distributed almost 1,500 condoms.

Tabling is an opportunity for members to speak at length with students. VOX's tables are decorated with two realistic dildos and a vulva model, used to demonstrate the correct way to use condoms and some of the basics of anatomy.

“We get people at the tables who are like, ‘I’ve seen some scary pictures of STIs and that’s all I know,’” Brianne said.
VOX gives anyone who's interested in listening a crash course in anatomy and safe sex, but even in the realm of contraceptives, students’ knowledge is limited.

“The two things that we have the hardest time pushing at our tables are the internal condoms and lube,” Brianne said.

Many people have never heard of an internal condom, which is a condom that is inserted into the vagina or anus prior to sex. It looks a little like a trash bag, Brianne admitted. But the FC2s come with many benefits. They are non-latex, a little softer than a traditional condom and have heat transfer. The overhang can be used as a dental dam, and they can be inserted a few hours before sexual activity.

Personal lubricant gets recognized more often, but it comes with its own set of stereotypes.

“We hear a lot of, ‘I don’t do butt stuff; why would I need that?’” Brianne said.

A common misconception about lube is that it's only for anal sex, but in reality, lube is also a pretty important bedroom accessory for penetrative vaginal sex; at least for individuals whose bodies don’t produce much natural lubrication.

The consequences of widespread ignorance regarding sexual health extend far beyond the physical effects. Ignorance breeds fear and shame. People need the facts to understand their bodies, and they need sources of support and affirmation.

“A mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage” is not, as [the government states](http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/FL%20Report%20-%20Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20Sunshine%20State.pdf), “the expected standard of sexual activity.” There is no such thing as a standard.

“Don’t feel shame about anything that’s happening to your body as a result of your sexual activity,” said Brianne. “I think that’s something that gets beaten into us as young adolescents, is that anything that happens as a result of our sexual desires is dirty and wrong, and that leads to people not seeking medical treatment when they have an issue.”

Empowerment is about the ability to make the choice that is right for you. It’s the ability to say either “yes” or “no,” because you want to, because it’s best for you and not because you think you should or you’re afraid of what someone else will think.

Be promiscuous; be celibate; be something in between. But know your resources, know your body, and don’t be afraid to talk about it.
