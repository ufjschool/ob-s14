Some call it extra-sensory perception. Some claim it is a sort of sixth sense. Others call it fake and a form of deception.

Whatever the view, it’s undeniable that there are many people who claim to have a variety of special powers that let them perceive beyond what the normal human can experience. 

There are energy readers who have the ability to see and manipulate the energy around humans. Psychics and fortunetellers predict the future. Mediums communicate with the dead and relay messages to the living. 

Their methods often range from eccentric to entirely nebulous, which is why there are so many who doubt the validity of their claims. These powers also have very little in the way of hard scientific support. 

So, is it possible that certain human beings can perceive further than others?

“I do think that there are some people out there, maybe they are vulnerable to some things that the rest of us are just closed off to,” said Jillian Geis, a language arts teacher at Lincoln Middle School in Gainesville,Fla. 

Geis had a friend growing up who claimed to have psychic powers and would use cards to help her make decisions. This friend said her mother was a witch and that she had the powers in her blood.

Although Geis would listen to the card readings, and in many instances, she found that the cards’ predictions turned out to be right, Geis was still skeptical that her friend was really psychic.

“I think some people are extremely in tune with nature around them and they feel like they are special and they have this gift,"  she said, "but I don’t think she had that gift." 

Geis did not take a firm stance. Although she said she believed some people could truthfully see the future or speak to the dead, it may just be a case of very intuitive people who can read others’ emotions. 
She did express a solid belief in the paranormal however, attributing it to her upbringing in Catholicism. Her faith’s beliefs in exorcisms lead her to believe there must be other kinds of spirits and energy as well. 

“I’ve watched enough movies and heard enough stories to believe that, ‘Yeah, I bet some of this stuff did happen,’” she said. 

Belief is one thing, but definitive proof of psychic powers still eludes the mainstream scientific community and, by association, the general public. Nonetheless, there are fields of academic study concerned with researching the paranormal. 


READING AURAS 

Andrew Nichols, who holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, teaches classes to the Gainesville community about honing psychic senses. He is also a parapsychologist, a practitioner of the field which explores how the human mind relates to things that exist beyond our typical five senses. 

He said he has had the ability to see energy since he was a child. He called it the ability to see “auras” that appeared to him as “misty luminescence” —similar to heat waves coming off of a sidewalk but in different colors.

“For a long time, I thought everyone could see them,” he said. “I would always mention them, and people would give me strange looks.”

Eventually his aunt pulled him aside and told him he had “the sight," needed to stop talking about it and learn to control it.

The color of an aura depends on many factors, according to Nichols, such as intellect, health and emotional state. Every living being has them, including plants, which typically have a blue or bluish-white aura.

Blue is the most common color for human auras as well, but that can change, especially with emotional swings. Interestingly enough, many popular clichés coincide with auras: depression leads to a dark blue aura — “feeling blue” — and rage leads to a dark red aura — “seeing red." 

“I believe those terms found their way into our universal vocabulary because people can subliminally sense those subtle energies,” he said.

Beyond those common auras, most aura colors mean different things depending on the person they surround and the energy reader. Nichols said this is because auras and energy are not seen with the physical eyes, but with the mind’s eye. Although the color is up for interpretation, he also clarified the energy fields themselves are very real and can even interact with each other. This is why certain people have “chemistry” or instant feelings toward one another.

“A variety of experiments have shown that the energy fields do either attract or repel one another,” he said. “They have a sort of electromagnetic quality to them.”

These energy fields can also rub off onto other things and other people. Every interaction between an aura and a physical object can result in a sort of psychic residue of the person being left on that object. Nichols said that’s what causes most hauntings: people who previously lived in a place have left their impressions on the building itself. There is the chance mediums, who claim to speak to the dead, are merely reading the imprints of the deceased persons on the client.

Mediumship is one of the more highly investigated types of psychic practices by parapsychologists, leading to what Nichols called a “strained relationship” between mediums and researchers. On the one hand, parapsychologists have done more to document mediums throughout history than any other researchers. On the other hand, parapsychologists have also exposed a lot of frauds.

Parapsychologists believe in auras and energy, thus believing in the merits of energy reading. Future-telling could be seen as more of a variation on energy reading and making good predictions based on the evidence, as opposed to an actual prophetic sight.

The notion of being able to communicate with dead people, however, is still a hotly debated topic in the community. No one is able to give a definitive answer on how it is done. 

DEFINING MEDIUMS 

Primarily in history, there have been two main types of mediums: physical and mental. Physical mediums conducted their sessions in dimly lit rooms and would make objects fly around, tables shake and a substance called ectoplasm exude from their bodies. The latter is more rare nowadays due to many of them being exposed as fakes. 

Mental mediums claim to hear the voices of the dead or see images in their minds before relaying them to their audiences. The entirely internal experience is more difficult to disprove, but mental mediums still have their detractors. The most common argument is they say such vague or obvious things that something they say is bound to have some significance to their client.

Nichols admitted mediums do say vague and generic things, called “cold reading,” as a form of biding time because they cannot turn on messages from the deceased at will. On the other hand, they may say something so specific and so personal that they could have only known it from that deceased person. That is proof, Nichols said, that they must have some connection to a different source of knowledge.

There are two main theories about how mediums receive their information. One is the Super ESP theory: Mediums can access knowledge from a sort of “cosmic database” where dead people’s consciousnesses have all melded together. The other is the Survivalist theory that says mediums are communicating with actual dead spirits. Both theories leave room for problems in the communication process. 

In the Super ESP hypothesis, a medium might not be able to distinguish what comes from his or her own subconscious and what comes from the cosmic conscious. Parapsychologists generally accept the concept of extrasensory perception but are unsure of its limits. It is entirely possible everything a medium “hears” is coming from within themselves and not external sources.

Nichols said many mediums are indeed biased by their personal beliefs. The root of psychosis is when the unconscious material of a person’s mind takes over his or her conscious mind. 
He referred to mediums as “walkers between the worlds.” Some mediums have difficulty functioning normally in the physical world, due to the problem of sorting of the streams of information from the conscious and the unconscious. 

Many psychics can be perfectly functional and hold a job, Nichols said, but many schizophrenics in psychiatric wards are psychics who have lost control of their ability to separate their conscious from the unconscious.
“The psychotic and the psychic are both immersed in the same sea,” he said, quoting his mentor, William Roll. “The difference is the psychic swims, the psychotic drowns.”

With so much debate about the nature of psychic abilities within the field of those who study it — combined with the flat-out rejection from many of the scientific community — the truth about psychic abilities may still be unclear for some time. However, Nichols said he believes that a scientific explanation is out there.
“I don’t think anything transcends nature,” he said. “Ultimately I think we will understand how these things work. This is really all about subtle energies.” 

##Carolyn Green: Energy Nurse

She is not just any type of nurse. Carolyn Green is an official “Energy Nurse.”

The one word she used to describe her work: fascinating.

Green assists in balancing the energy field in one’s body, also commonly known as the auric field. The energy system goes much deeper than just the field around them. It has an anatomy of its own.

“The advantage to that is it helps to regulate the physical, mental and spiritual body to open the window of accelerated healing,” Green said. 

After graduating from Seminole State College in 1983, Green became a registered nurse. In 2010, She got certified in healing touch, a form of energy medicine that balances the human energy system. Accredited by the American Holistic Nurses Association, it's used in hospitals, nursing homes and cancer centers. Green also received her certification in medical intuition, quantum work and life coaching. 

From her hometown of Northern Bronx, New York, Green saw and heard spirits since her earliest memories at 2 years old when she first realized she was sensitive to noise. By the time she was 3 or 4 years old, she started going to birthday parties and couldn’t stand the children screaming and yelling while playing. She was highly emotional and sensitive to the children around her. 

She was also hypersensitive to sounds and light. Flash photography felt brighter than the sun, so she had to wear sunglasses. Her eye doctor told her it was not likely for her to be so sensitive to light because she had dark eyes that provided enough protection from the light.  

When she was 10, her father passed away. She thought she was being watched. By the age of 12, Green started to see energy around things, an ability known as clairvoyance. She was also able to hear the energies around her, known as clairaudience. This ability was something she understood later on in life as functioning on a higher frequency level. Today it’s referred to as higher sensory perception, or HSP.

“It is like taking your basic senses to the second floor,” Green said. 

Green’s abilities never shook her faith. Green is Jewish and believes in one God. In Judaism, her abilities are accepted. Judaism has the Kabbalah, a book of Jewish mysticism, and the Zohar. 

She spoke with her rabbi a couple of years ago, and he told her one-on-one that he thought she had a gift from God and was glad she was using it to help people. He prided her courage to go public with her work. 

A lot of people in her family were very open-minded and knew each of them had a sixth sense in one way or another, which made it easier for her to open up about her paranormal experiences.

Green doesn't pay much mind to the skeptics. She doesn’t just believe in what she does, she knows of what is real and validated. Skeptics give her an opportunity to show them something they might have never been open to.

“Everyone is entitled to [his] or her own opinion,” Green said. “I don’t want to necessarily change their belief — just their experience.”

Susan Provda, a client of Green, wasn't skeptical before her first visit. She was just someone in dire pain after two back surgeries looking for Green’s help. After hearing about Green from a friend, Provda decided to see her. She went to the Green’s Apopka Wellness Center in Apopka, Fla., where she was comforted by light talk about her medical history and progressive relief after visiting three more times for back therapy. 

Provda said the experience was very professional. She laid down as Green used a crystal pendulum to read her energy field and work her hands in her back, where she sensed blockage. Green validated moments in her life that no one would know outside of her family. Provda has felt much better, partly because she came in with an open mind and heart, making it easier for Green to communicate with her.

“It’s healing, therapeutic," Provda said. "She listens really well.” 

While using a crystal pendulum to assess the person’s energy field, Green works with a collective of more than 20 angels and guides with all her senses to tune in for information on the healing process of her patients. The human energy system is colored in chakras, energy transformers that feed the circle of light around and through the body. The colors and the frequencies of the chakras are aligned with the colors of the rainbow. If a chakra is blocked, it can affect the complete circuit. She uses her hands to palpate where the imbalances are in the body indicated by the pendulum moving side-to-side. When the field was open and balanced, the pendulum would move in a circular motion. It is the oldest form of medicine, she said.

Green also does grief work because many departed loved ones make their presence known to her to help their families who are still grieving.

Whether it is grief work or a serious illness, many people see Green as a last resort to maintain their health in a natural way. Energy work fits with western methods because it accelerates the healing process of someone going through medical treatments. Also it balances their systems quicker to decrease their medication dosages. She advises her clients to continue all prescribed medication and to inform the doctors if they note any changes. 

She is also the author of "Getting to Know You: Guided Pearls of Wisdom for a More Soulful Experience." 

“The Spirit moved me,” Green said.

About 14 years ago, she channeled messages from a spirit that she thought were messages, which turned out to be the book. She wrote the book in four months. In the book, she mentioned 18 concepts of awareness that the guides and angels made her aware of to work through systematically to help re-establish healthier thought patterns in all aspects of life. They also teach how to learn to clear a mind cluttered with past issues that affect the physical, mental and spiritual body.

A type of nonproductive thought pattern is experienced by people who live in fear from past experiences that are brought into the present and future. 

The most powerful part of our bodies is our higher consciousness. It is soul-driven and will not steer us wrong if we learn to tune into it. The energy field compromises everything: the mind, body and soul. It takes care of our physical and non-physical, she said. A type of nonproductive thought pattern is experienced by people who live in fear from past experiences that are brought into the present and future. 

Green is working on her certification as a certified holistic nurse through the American Holistic Nurses Association. On her downtime, Green works at the Wellness Center that she and her husband have owned for almost 35 years. She also enjoys the company of her husband, Adlai; three children, Ian, Arielle and Alexa; and her 85-year-old mother, Harriet Storyk. She anticipates writing another book in a couple of years.

“We are amazing beings with all the answers within ourselves to lead a healthy and productive life,” Green said.
