HED: Anatomy of an Athete 

DEK: Athletes + Energy 

For some University of Florida athletes, energy is the electric buzz of techno music. For others, it’s caffeine coursing through their veins. Energy is a green Gatorade bottle or a protein bar. It’s feeling cold water sliding down your throat during an afternoon practice or the smell of a sizzling steak at dinnertime. Energy is that moment of complete mental and physical suspension before the gun goes off, a whistle sounds or the ball is passed. It’s a team prayer, the words of a coach, the hopeful cries of fans. For athletes at UF, just the mere sight of an orange and blue jersey is enough to power them up, excite their spirits and send them flying full-force into the performances of their lifetimes.

Talent takes an athlete only so far. Behind the record-setting times, the slam dunks, the "SportsCenter" Top-10-worthy plays and the perfect 10.0s lies months of preparation with a staff that stands ready to infuse energy into both the bodies and the minds of these athletes. Like an actor on stage, an individual athlete collaborates with a team of backstage managers in order to give their best possible performance on gameday.

We sat down with some of UF's top-performing athletes and the people who impact them most. 


##MEN'S SWIMMING

It’s 6 a.m. when the bright lights of the Stephen C. O’Connell Center indoor pool switch on and the members of the UF swim team trickle in. Tommy Stich, athletic trainer for the team, spends his time filling orange Gatorade tubs, treating flu-season colds, and waiting for the sun to rise and a new day to begin.

After a two-hour practice, he heads over to the weight room where the team holds an hour-long strength-and-conditioning session. His day continues with an afternoon practice, post-practice treatments and rehabilitation — not to mention appointment scheduling, paperwork and staff meetings.

Throw swim meets into the mix and you have a near 24/7 job.

“It's so easy to take care of people at UF. We have so many resources,” Stich said. “And if you can’t figure something out, there’s always a bunch of other people that can. We’re all working together.”

After studying kinesiology at Fresno State and LSU, Stich worked with volleyball, lacrosse and tennis teams. When he ventured to the Swamp, he found his true training rhythm in swimming.

“Swimmers are disciplined,” he said. “It’s humbling to be around people that are so focused on what they do every day. It makes you better.”

The focus and discipline are rewards reaped from a program sown with demands and challenges both in and out of the pool. The result: producing some of the top swimmers in the nation.

Intimidating? Matt Thompson thought so.

Thompson had swum competitively since he was 5 years old, attending and placing at multiple Junior Olympic meets. Yet, the sports management junior still felt too inadequate to wear orange and blue. 
“I was always looking at the [UF swimming] record boards and the wall of champions,” the now 21-year-old said. “They’ve done all these things…. I’m not that good. There’s no way. That was just kind of my mindset at the time.”

But the support from his club coach, Cashel Mack, quickly uprooted any of his self-doubt. After he placed second in the 200-yard Individual Medley and third in the 500-yard freestyle at the FHSAA Championship meet his junior year of high school on Nov. 13, 2009, the swimmer's doubts were put to rest. Mack pulled him out of the pool at his next practice and reassured him of his talent as an elite swimmer and his untapped potential. 

“She told me, ‘Look, you really can do this, and if you want to be serious with swimming and be the best you can be, Florida is the option,'” Thompson recalled. “From that moment, it was Florida No. 1 all the way.”

As a Gator, Thompson and his 37 teammates compete from September through April. With this constant get-up-and-go energy among the swimmers, Stich, pays special attention to maintaining each athlete’s energy.

“There are some days where they all just looked drained,” Stich said. “We just communicate: every day, all day, communicating about everybody. I think a lot of people kind of feed off that.”

For Thompson, it’s crucial for athletes to be proactive in making time in their schedules to see both the trainers and coaches, especially when something is hurting.

“With the training program, you can overwork things,” he said. “If you’re not feeling well and you’re having a bad practice and you just don’t speak up about it, it can look like you’re just not trying. Communication is definitely the biggest thing.”
 
To combat the wear and tear of swimming on the body, the team engages in daily weight room preventative exercises, fuels with Gatorade Prime Chews and the carbohydrate powder, Vitargo, and focuses on hydrating throughout the day.

“People probably don’t think about it with swimmers, but they sweat in the water,” Stich said. “It’s a little bit dangerous compared to other sports.”

The sports nutrition office and weight room also offer a variety of ways to energize the swim team. Post-weight room sessions call for protein bars and shakes while snacks such as mixed nuts line shelves and a rainbow of Gatorade stocks the nutrition office fridge. But energy intake doesn’t stop at food and water.

“Our sport is so demanding that it has to be a lifestyle in order to be successful,” Thompson said. “You really want to make sure you get a good night’s sleep.”

But standing behind the blocks on race day and listening to the cheers of teammates and fans echo throughout the pool facility is what makes the countless hours of training, athletic treatment and weight room sessions worth it.

“The more energy that you have from people on the side of the pool cheering you on, the more amped up you get,” Thompson said. “The support from the coaches and everyone around you is really great, and it gives you that extra gear and boost to really know that you can do it.”

At the Ohio State Invitational on Nov. 23, 2013, Thompson put that extra gear into motion. Performing well in the 200-yard freestyle in the morning, he swam his way to a personal best of 1:37.60 in the top-eight heat that evening.

“I kind of proved myself in some way,” he said.

And although falling short of qualifying for the national meet March 27 through 29, 2014, his gradual improvement in the pool has continued to fuel him. With other members of the team, Thompson drove 16 hours to the University of Texas in Austin to support the Gators at NCAAs. Not only did he get to watch and learn from the best of college swimming, but he also helped support the men to a strong third-place finish.

“Even times where our crew was muffled out by the hundreds of Texas fans, one of the guys said, ‘I don’t need to hear you guys. I just need to look up and see you,’” said Thompson. “We were sure to Gator Chomp the whole time and be loud and rowdy and make as much energy as we can for the guys.”

Aspiring to represent UF at Nationals his senior year, Thompson also has his eyes on something bigger: the 2016 Olympic Trials.

“I didn’t make Olympic Trials for 2012…but I ended up qualifying a week after the meet was over,” he said. “If you have qualified to swim at trials and you never go, to me that is an incomplete year.”

With the support from coaches like Gregg Troy and Anthony Nesty and an athletic trainer like Stich, Thompson has little doubt in his future swimming career. 

“We as humans are capable of way more than we think we are. That’s something that was kind of learned out of the pool,” he said.  “You are always capable of working harder and pushing yourself beyond the limits that you think you have set for yourself because in reality, there are no limits.”

## Gymnastics 

When senior Aliana Johnson enters a room, her 5-foot-1 stature and winning smile don’t exactly scream intense athlete. Watch her run toward a vault at full speed with nothing but concentration on her face, and it’s no surprise why she is a national champion. 

Johnson, an All-American first-team for all-around in gymnastics, had a stellar senior year and she helped UF win back-to-back national championships in April. The Texas native set an all-time Gator record score of 39.825 against West Virginia in all-around earlier this year. Johnson’s natural athleticism and talent clearly have helped her have a fantastic senior year, but there is one other factor that Johnson says helps her perform at her best: nutrition. 

Johnson credits her mother for helping her eat healthy from a young age, so when she came to UF, guidance on what to eat from nutritionists was not needed. 

However as a junior, Johnson suffered a stress fracture in her lower back, making her aware of how important nutritionists truly are.  

“I learned how nutrition is very helpful,” Johnson recalled, “how you have to give your body the right stuff. I wasn’t practicing at all, so I needed to fuel my body properly. I was doing the bike and SwimEx to keep in shape as much I could so I could come back strong and do what I needed to do for the team.”

Johnson added more protein to her diet to help her get back into competition. After being out for eight meets, Johnson returned to competition in the NCAA Regionals, where she scored her own personal best scores of the season.  

Kelsee Gomes, the sports nutritionist assigned to UF gymnastics, said when it comes to gymnasts, her main concern is making sure they get enough protein and carbs. 

“They won’t condition as much in season, so it kind of becomes another strength and power sport that relays more on protein,” Gomes said. 

The sports nutrition program was implemented at UF in 1999, making it the second school to start a program — after Nebraska. To this day, the program is one of the only programs that focuses on all sports. 

Athletes, like Johnson, have learned to take full advantage of the nutrition program to help them throughout the season. Johnson usually stops by the office three times a week to grab a ZonePerfect Nutrition bar after practice to help refuel. 

Gomes said when it comes to being a nutritionist, it’s more about the individual athlete than the sport. Some athletes will want basic guidelines, while others will want an exact breakdown. As a whole, most gymnasts will use fruit and low-fat diary for their carb intake.  

Johnson has a customary meal on days when she has home meets that helps keep her fueled throughout the meet. 

“Whenever we’re home, I always go get a Publix wrap with ham, cheese, mustard and all the vegetables on it, like, around 12:30,” Johnson said, “and then, right before we go out for warm-ups, which is around 4, I’ll have like a banana and almond butter.”

During the meet, gymnasts will have small snacks to keep them energized. Besides food, Johnson attributes her teammates for helping her keep her energy levels up. 

“I’m very energetic during practice," she said, "and I feel like being energetic helps others be energetic. We kind of feed off one another and that helps having other people in the gym that are just excited, making jokes and being funny." 

Gomes is just happy she can be part of the puzzle that makes a good athlete.  Johnson can confirm that the feeling is mutual.

“I love Kelsee. She’s awesome,” the gymnast said. “She works with us, and she does really well. She’s definitely been a good impact with different areas that I maybe didn’t know as much about, so it’s been really good to have her." 

Before Johnson knew she would stand with her team at the end of the season with another national title, Johnson admitted she had no regrets and just wanted to have fun in her last year at Florida. She certainly had all the right tools for success. This includes the nutrition to keep her energized —something that Sarah Snyder, director of UF's program, can’t stress the importance of enough.

“Everybody needs a nutritionist or dietitian to guide them through,” Snyder said. “It’s a year-long season: inseason, preseason, offseason. These athletes don’t rest.”

## Men's Basketball 

When the Gators took on the Kentucky Wildcats at Rupp Arena on Feb. 15, ESPN displayed before-and-after pictures of UF seniors Will Yeguete, Casey Prather, Scottie Wilbekin and Patric Young. Each looked more pumped up than the next, with muscles so defined, you'd think Michelangelo sculpted them himself. Those three men who were once lanky and looked like your average teenager about to play basketball at the neighborhood court are now some of the strongest athletes in men’s college basketball. All are products of Preston Greene’s training programs.

Greene has been the team’s strength and conditioning coordinator for three seasons. Every day throughout the year, he’s with the team making them stronger, faster and more flexible than the day they were recruited. He’s the guy on the court before the game stretching the players out who all the girls in the stands squeal about wishing they could be with. Of all the individuals who help contribute to the performance of a UF men’s basketball player, Greene is literally the most hands on.

Yeguete said you can see Greene’s impact during games by watching how the Gators move on the court.

“We play against teams that can’t keep up with us because we are better conditioned than they are," Yeguete said. "I think that’s a credit to Preston.”

Preston's effect on the team begins on Day 1 when incoming freshmen enroll for the Summer B semester at the end of June. Throughout voluntary off-season training sessions, Greene begins to evaluate each player and creates a personal program to fix what he calls their “weak link.”

The Clemson alum compares the process to getting your car aligned. Like when you let go of your steering wheel to see what direction your car goes in, basketball players are the same when they move on the court and in the weight room.

"Guys may be quicker to their right than they are to their left," Greene explained. "They may be tighter in one muscle than another one that works synergistically with the other. They may be stronger in one part of the body versus another part of the body. Those ratios change throughout the season just because of the way they move, the way they play, injuries."

After a head-to-toe breakdown on each basketball player analyzing their tightest and weakest spots, Greene prescribes certain exercises, movements, sets and reps to align each player's steering wheel.

For the players, having Greene around is basically like having a personal trainer at their disposal.

“I always tell them, ‘Hey! When you leave here, you’ll be paying some idiot a hundred dollars to do this, so you might as well take advantage of it now,’” Greened jested.

And Yeguete eats it up.

"I learned so much more about my body: stretching, how the stretching works, eating well," the 22-year-old said. "Preston knows a lot about the body, and he's good about sharing those things with us. He gives us a lot of advice about preparing our bodies for each season."

And with each season, the training program is altered as the players grow and improve. After the season is over, Greene meets with Gators coach Billy Donovan and his staff to set goals for each player. Optimal body weights are their focus.

“I want my guys to be very, very lean,” Greene stressed, “because the leaner or less body fat they have, for basketball, the quicker they are and the higher they can jump. If a guy has, in my opinion, a higher body fat than I would like, then I will determine his body weight off of that." 

When Yeguete enrolled at UF in 2010, a different strength and conditioning coordinator was on staff, Matt Herring. After Greene took Herring's place, the 6-foot-8 forward suffered injury after injury: concussions, a broken foot and knee problems. Last year, he underwent several arthroscopic surgeries to remove bone chips in his right knee. Once healthy and ready to hit the court again, Yeguete had to revamp his body for his final year with the team.

“My junior year, I was heavy — top heavy," he said.

So Greene set a goal for Yeguete: lose weight.

“I was about 240 at the start of the season," Yeguete noted. "Now I’m at 223. My goal was to be 222, so I went down, like, 15 pounds. That just shows how Preston works."

Greene's training program didn't just work for the athlete. It excelled. Yeguete was a starting forward for most of the 2013-2014 season with the highest consecutive starts on the team and racked up 909 minutes and 201 rebounds.

With the Gators finishing the season as SEC champions and making it to the Final Four in the NCAA tournament, Greene couldn't be happier. His enthusiasm, however, is a staple for the team — win or lose.

“One way I’ve been successful is I’m very, very energetic and very passionate about what we do," he described. "So when my guys come in to train, they tend to feed off my energy. When they come in, I’m ready to go right off the bat.”

On the court, Yeguete feeds off his own passion.

“Playing basketball here is really fun," he raved. "It’s been really, really fun being here. Being out there, having fun with my teammates — that’s what keeps me going — Just going out there and doing what I love to do. It’s fun going out there with them and just trying to get better and seeking greatness."

And greatness is expected for the team.

“They know from Day 1 that there is a certain level of expectation that needs to be met on the court," Greene revealed. “Coach Donovan tells these guys during the recruiting process and during their time here, 'We are going to work in this program. You’re not just going to show up and play games. You are going to practice every day. You are going to condition. You are going to lift weights. You are going to do all these things in order to be successful, and that’s kind of the values of our program.' Our program is based on hard work. They get this message from everybody.”

Everyone includes former Gator athletes who have gone on to play in the NBA — guys like Joakim Noah, Bradley Beal and Chandler Parsons.

"They see these guys come back and work, and that really hits home with our young guys," Greene noted. "It’s like, ‘Hey! OK, these guys are not just talented. They work to be successful.’”

For the freshmen, the seniors spread the message, set a good example and amp up the energy.

“We have to lead the team," Yeguete stressed. "We have to be ready to go every single day, and we have to make sure they’re ready to go every single day, so we have to bring it."

##WOMEN'S TRACK 

Looking at the European snow-capped mountains for the last time, Agata Strausa knew she was going to need much more than coffee and her favorite dark chocolate to get her through this trip.

Two years ago, Strausa, now 24, left behind her Latvian family and her career in product design at the Art School Berlin Weissensee to pursue her dream of becoming a professional distance runner.

“When I saw the plane take off, it was very strange,” she recalled. “I thought how within a minute a life can totally change and how blessed I was to have this opportunity to start as somebody else, somewhere else.”

Trying to relax on the nine-hour flight to the United States, she closed her eyes and thought about the upcoming days. In less than 24 hours, she’d be in another country and walk into her first UF art history class. In a month, she’d lace up her spikes, slip on her orange-and-blue jersey and compete for the first time as a mid-distance track runner. 

“Energy is more in the mind than in the body,” she said. “It’s not so much about how you fuel yourself and your body but more like how your attitude is.”

Strausa was born motivated. Determined to balance both athletics and academics, she spent nearly three hours a day commuting from school to the other side of the city for her team’s practices. Pulling all-nighters and squeezing in extra studio hours on the weekend, she was tired of being torn. As a result, she decided to transfer to UF for her final two years of undergraduate study.

“German universities don’t know a collegiate competitive athletic program, so academics and athletics were separated with little understanding of each other,” she said. “I had to beg professors to excuse my absence if I had to compete somewhere.”

Adding to her troubles, the German Athletic Association had forbidden Strausa’s coach, Beate Conrad — who at that time was the German national coach for women’s distance running — to continue coaching Strausa because she was technically a citizen of Latvia and, therefore, a potential competitor against Germany.

“Without a coach or a support system, I couldn’t make my dream to be an elite runner come true,” Strausa said.

But at UF, not only would Strausa be committed to both her studies and to her athletics, but she would also have the full support of a coach and a group of teammates practically outside her door.

“My roommates, who were also my teammates, made it really easy for me,” she said. “They were my energy.”

Callie Cooper, 23, a UF graduate last year and a former UF distance runner, was a guide and mentor for Strausa. A horticulture science major and former vegan, Cooper had fully embraced Gainesville’s agricultural corners. Trader Joe’s excursions, Wednesday farmers' market runs and organic pre-run breakfasts had quickly become the heart of “The Coop” — the name of Cooper and Strausa’s four-bedroom home that they shared with two other girls.

“It was a little tough at first because we were strangers and everything was so new to her,” Cooper said, who now resides in Eugene, Ore., and runs for Team Run Eugene running club. “It was awesome to be able to travel all over the states together for meets, and she came home with me for a couple of Thanksgivings.”

But the excitement of living in this Florida farm town, studying at a new school and competing on a team much larger than hers in Germany didn’t even compare to how she felt before her first indoor race as a Gator. Only a month after moving, Strausa debuted in the 3,000-meter race at the Husky Classic at the University of Washington in Seattle. Stepping onto the track with some of the top collegiate distance runners in the country and professionals representing companies such as Nike and Adidas left her completely speechless.

“I was so pumped and excited and energized the first time I put the Florida jersey on to compete,” Strausa said. “That was a special moment for me.”

Focused on the race and getting to the starting line on time, Strausa remembers stepping out of her warm-up clothes a little too early. UF track and field coach Mike Holloway was by her side with compassion, advice and some pre-race encouragement.

“It meant that my head coach really cares about me and has, like, his eyes on us all of the time,” she said. “He takes his job really seriously and takes what we do really seriously.”

The energy from her coaches and teammates cheering on the sidelines helped her cruise to the finish line, running a personal finals best of 9:17. After that, she knew UF had been the right choice. Fast-forward two years, and that same energy is far from depleted. 

“Every athlete is just as good as his support system,” she said.

Andy Klock, head UF track and field athletic trainer, is one big part of Strausa’s success. Spending up to 70 hours a week with the team during the season, Klock enjoys helping the athletes reach their potential not just in their sport, but in life.

“We constantly try to maintain a very positive atmosphere in the athletic training room,” he said. “One technique I utilize as well is reminding the athlete that the only person they are competing with is themselves.”

Much of Strausa’s schedule revolves around working with her trainers to prevent injuries, a nutritionist to create meal plans and a weight coach to improve strength. But at the end of the day, her energy and motivation always comes back to her teammates.

Together with the girls on her team, she pounds out lap after lap in the Florida sun on UF’s blue track. Together, they wake up on Saturdays at 6 a.m. for 90-minute runs in Micanopy, which is a tiny town located South of UF. Together, they pass off a baton during a distance medley relay, placing third at the 2014 indoor national meet. 

“It’s about going through something together with someone and sharing joy and pain,” Strausa said. “It’s always easier when they’re around.”

Graduating in May, Strausa has led her own Gator legacy. Although her two-year life in Gainesville was never easy, her challenges have changed the way she lives everyday. 

“What takes most energy for me is to overthink things, judge oneself and not forgive mistakes,” she said. “I’ve learned that it is OK to have crappy races, miserable moods and pizza or chocolate. It’s about what you do the next day, what consequences you take for yourself to be a better person in the future.”
