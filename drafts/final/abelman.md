HED: Mr. Positive Push 

DEK: Comedy + Energy 


Everyone has their definition of rock bottom. Some people know it just in case -- almost as a measure. Some people know it when they feel it. It could be losing your job, going bankrupt, breaking up with a significant other or even eating the whole carton of ice cream. For Brody Stevens, rock bottom was lying in a hospital bed. 

He didn't get in an accident. Nothing had to be operated on. He had no apparent injuries; however, there he was lying in a hospital bed in UCLA. But this wasn't the intensive care unit. This was the psychiatric ward, and no one was more in shock than Brody himself. 

"I never, ever, ever thought I would end up in a hospital, never," he remarked in a phone interview. "I didn’t even know that stuff happened." 

No one would expect "that kind of stuff" to happen to a guy who boasts positive energy as a mantra and makes a living off making people laugh. 

Positive energy started as Brody's shtick back in college. The 43-year-old, born Steven Brody, pitched for Arizona State University's baseball team. Being an athlete — especially in a sport of failure — taught him how unhealthy negativity could be. He turned to learning about visualization and the power of positive thoughts. After graduating, Brody moved to Seattle. There he starred on a public-access TV show with Teina Manu, a fellow comedian, aptly named "Brody and Teina." Their friendship validated what he learned at ASU. 

"He taught me, ‘Hey! Be nice! Be happy!” Brody reminisced. "I just applied what I had learned in college into comedy and what I learned in baseball, then it took someone to be like, ‘Hey! I’m like that, too.’" 

His positive energy began taking him places — from New York, where he became friends with Zach Galifianakis, back to his home of Los Angeles. Brody went from warming up the audience for late night shows like "Chelsea Lately" and doing podcasts to guest hosting "TMZ", performing at festivals all around the country and appearing in the movies "The Hangover" and "Due Date." On deck was an HBO series. 

“I was on a streak," Brody revealed. "I was on a hot streak, and I was feeling good."

Brody grappled with anxiety for years before going on medication to control it. But in 2011, medication no longer seemed necessary to him as he buzzed with success. 

Stopping abruptly sent Brody's hot streak into a total meltdown, and everyone knew about it. In his own words, he went nuts. Under his Twitter handle @allthingsbrody, he basically live-tweeted his manic episode for the world to pull up a chair and view. His followers saw his tweets shift from seeming like a nice guy to two days of confrontational rants about having a gun, filled with unprecedented cursing in all-caps. But his tweets constantly had #positivity at the end. He started filming himself threatening people in parking lots and uploading the videos to YouTube. Off social media, Brody began cutting off his friends, starting with Galifianakis. 

Back in 2011, Galifianakis became the driving force for not only getting Brody the help he needed but also helping him get his own show.  For years, Galifianakis told Brody that he was interested in doing a show about him. 

“He always thought it was funny the way I interacted with my sister," Brody explained, "and he thought my mind was kind of interesting." 

So they taped a pilot. The documentary-style episode focused on Brody and his sister, Stephanie, reconciling for his mom's 80th birthday. Later Galifianakis and Brody pitched it to Comedy Central, HBO and Adult Swim, and all the networks liked it. HBO eventually ordered five more episodes and  gave Brody two months to plan before taping. 

However, in those two months, the tweeting started, and Galifianakis starting getting hostile voicemails. With the help of Brody's manager, Dave Rath, Galifianakis contacted Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's Psychiatric Emergency Team. Officers involuntarily detained Brody after he got out of the shower and brought him in for evaluation. 

Having that positive energy was crucial to his recovery. Knowing what helped him in the past, Brody knew he had to focus on the positive to help him recover. However, now it was no longer part of his act.

"I kind of had to get myself out of this hole," he divulged. "It wasn’t like, 'Oh, I’m a nice guy, positive energy.' I really needed positive energy to get me out of the hole. I just learned that by generating that energy that good stuff can happen. Good things started to happen. I put certain emotions out in the universe, and good things happened again.” 

In the hospital, the focus of the show shifted. Seventeen days in the psych ward was not enough to take the show away from him or curb his motivation. 

"My friends are saying it’s, like, kind of rock 'n' roll. It’s kind of funny," Brody recounts with levity, spinning his rock bottom into something more glamourous and hardcore than his actual diagnosis of bipolar disorder. "It’s not funny, but it is a little bit. Nobody got hurt. I mean, it could have been bad. But that’s when they kind of started putting it in my head." 

Sitting in bed, Brody started mapping out his new vision for the show. His goal for those first five episodes was basic.  

“I wanted to go from the hospital to doing stand up on TV," Brody explained, giving himself a clear beginning and end to achieve. "That would be a big leap.” 

He felt having this goal was realistic and smart. Instead of gunning for a nationwide tour or starring in a sitcom, he had his eyes on doing a stand-up set on the late night show "Conan." With this in mind, Brody started brainstorming the steps he would take to achieve his goal: taking acting classes, going to New Orleans to try to be in "The Campaign," analyzing his issues via a baseball fantasy.

"Brody Stevens: Enjoy It!" premiered on Comedy Central and HBO Digital in December 2013, introducing viewers to Brody's story of positive energy, family and recovery. 

Don't expect Brody to put Mr. Positive Energy under his name on his business card any time soon, though. 
"Being positive is never going to go out of style," he noted. "It’s never going to be wrong. So me as a performer, I don’t have to label myself like that." 
Instead, he'd rather Mr. Positive Push, because he thinks that's funnier and a new spin on the term that people seem to throw around a lot. 
"As a comedian,I like to keep it fresh," Brody said, "so now I’m more into Positive Push."
