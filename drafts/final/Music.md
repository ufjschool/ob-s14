Music makes the people come together, Madonna sang.

Rihanna doesn’t want us to stop it, white boys play it funky and the hills were alive with the sound of it.
For college students across Gainesville, music provides an escape from, a soundtrack to and a major part of their lives.

Every day, thousands of students walk up Newell Road, through Turlington Plaza and across the Reitz Union lawn with headphones in ear. Some are the bulky, over-the-ear, cost-$300-of-my-parents-money variety. Others are the frayed, frazzled, why-would-I-buy-headphones-when-they-come-with-my-phone type.

And all of them are blaring different types of music directly into our ears. Justin Bieber, Iron Maiden, or Ludwig van Beethoven — whatever is coming through your speakers affects your mood and how you think.

For Lorena Marerro, a 21-year-old psychology major at UF, music helps her get through her running.
Marerro completed the Trail of Payne 10 K on March 29. During the race, she said she tried to match the tempo of the songs she listened to with how fast she was running.

“Like 180 beats per minute, because that’s what we’re trying to have as our stride,” she said. “Long distance, Beyonce, she’s great.”

Another competitor at Trail of Payne was Nick Johns, a 22-year-old biology major at UF. Johns decided to take a different approach to his run, opting for country and rock music instead of hip-hop.

“It was really soothing,” Johns said. “It just helped me coast and get my mind off running.”

However, music doesn’t just help people get through their exercise. It can help people get through some of the toughest times.

Daniel Bowen, a 19-year-old history major at UF, doesn’t just listen to contemporary music. His favorite genre dates back hundreds of years, and his taste for classical music is attributable to one person — his late grandfather.

Bowen said his grandfather, Alex Panamá, composed music after he retired and introduced him to the music at a young age. He said Panamá went to Julliard and lived in Paris while studying under famous composers Juliette Nadia Boulanger and Pierre Boulez.

But Panamá spent much of his life managing a cable company in El Salvador, and music became something he did in his free time.

“He took his musical life kind of as a side hobby,” Bowen said. “It wasn’t until maybe about 10 years before he died that he started really composing full time because he was retired by then.He made concertos, symphonies, sonatas, the works.”

Late in his life, Panamá shared his love of classical music with Bowen, sitting down to watch and listen to videos and CDs of classical performances.

“He’d be like, ‘Go up, pick one, and we can watch it or listen to it,’” Bowen said. “It would just be him and me chilling out on the sofa. It was those memories that whenever I listen to Beethoven’s Fifth or any Wagner overture, it’s like my grandpa’s there with me.”

When Panamá died in September 2010, Bowen said the music Panamá introduced him to helped him cope with his grandfather’s death.

“I would stay in my room and listen to a bunch of sad symphonies,” he said. “Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7, Wagner’s Funeral March, Chopin’s sonatas, stuff like that. It really brought memories of him back, but it also showed me that this is what my grandfather’s left me.

“That was a rough month. But luckily classical music was there, and it helped me get through a really sad time and here now.”

Now, classical music is Bowen’s lifeline. He listens to it when he’s happy. He listens to it when he’s sad. He listens to it when he just wants to relax.

“It all depends on what kind of mood I’m in,” he said. “If I’m happy, I’m going to listen to probably some Beethoven, some symphony, or maybe a (Franz) Schubert sonata or a (Johann) Strauss waltz. If I’m sad, I’m going to listen to maybe some 
Wagner overtures or some Tchaikovsky symphonies.”

Bowen said he has a pair of noise-canceling headphones that he likes to use when he relaxes and listens to music. He uses them primarily for classical music, saying that contemporary pop music is fine when he’s listening to the radio or doing house work, but not when he wants to take the time to really listen.

“Classical music for me is more calm but yet more intense,” he said. “Contemporary music is just music for me. It’s something that I sing along to on the radio or I have playing in the background … But it’s not something I actually sit down and exert energy listening to.”

Although Bowen has used classical music to get through some of the toughest experiences he has gone through, he said the music hasn't been tainted for him.

“It’s really gotten me through a lot of difficult times in my life,” he said. “But it’s also propelled me and motivated me at times when I’m at my peak.”

Some people are not content to merely be passive music consumers, however. 

Nick Stampar, a 19-year-old international studies major at UF, has taken his love of music to the next level and has 
started writing his own songs.

“If I had to pick what concepts or influences sort of define who I see myself as currently, I would say music is No. 1, and probably the next few down are all subsets of that,” he said.

Stampar said his desire to create songs stemmed from his own love for music.

“That came from The Beatles,” he said. “I was like, ‘I need to know how to play guitar so I can play these songs.’ From that, it started with The Beatles and then I would just start to learn stuff here or there.”

Stampar said he started writing music with his former roommate, Byron Hazzard, last Fall. He and Hazzard would play together on the streets of Miami when they both attended the University of Miami.

Stampar transferred to UF, but Hazzard still goes to Miami. To continue working on music together, Stampar sends clips of what he is working on to Hazzard.

“Usually what I’ll do is, let’s say I’m playing guitar and I hit something and I’m like, ‘Oh that sounds good,’ I will pull up the voice memos app on my phone, record it in like three different tones with like different guitars and stuff and send those to [Hazzard],” he said. 

He said the two make a good team, with Stampar doing his best work writing songs’ bridges while Hazzard works on the choruses. 

However, Stampar said he has trouble when he’s trying to write — he can’t get all his ideas into compact concepts.

“There’s just so many bands and artists that have influenced me so profoundly, musically and as a person, that I want all of them to manifest in my music,” he said. “It just can’t happen. Plus, there’s this pressure that I feel like I need to have some sort of consistency in my music … If I did what my mind wants me to do, which is like, 'Oh, write a song like Paul McCartney, then write a song like Jimi Hendrix, then write a John Mayer song, then write an Arctic Monkeys song and a Killers song,' no one would be able to hold onto what I was doing.”

Despite being influenced by so many artists, Stampar said his favorite songs that he has written came when he wasn’t trying to sound like anyone else, saying that several times he has tried writing songs, finished and then scrapped them. But that hasn’t stopped him.

“I’m always looking for another door to take,” Stampar said, “It’s like one of those puzzle books where you pick — like an RPG puzzle book where you like pick which way to go, and then the next one you got like three options, and then you got to figure out your way to a solution. I’m always looking for another open door.”
