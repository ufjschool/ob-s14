School teaches us that equations make up different forms of energy. A bunch of letters, exponents and fractions somehow come together to equal how things in our lives move.

Kinetic energy equals 1/2mv^2

Potential energy equals m · g · h

For Orange + Blue, energy equals 20 students plus everything we've learned during our years studying at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. We came together in the Spring of 2014 to make a magazine exploring energy beyond what’s in a textbook. A talented core of writers, editors, designers and photographers delved into the lives of drag queens and athletes, and spent time in coffee shops and haunted halls among other places to create their own energy equations.
