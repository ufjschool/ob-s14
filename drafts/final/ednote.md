Back in high school, you probably learned equations and forms of energy. A bunch of letters, exponents and fractions somehow come together to equal how things in our lives move.  

Kinetic energy equals 1/2mv^2 (Make that an exponent, please!) 

Potential energy equals m · g · h 

For Orange + Blue, energy equals TK students plus everything we've learned during our years in the J-School. Everyone came together this semester to make up a magazine exploring forms of energy beyond what we learned in Physics. A bunch of writers, editors, designers and photographers delved into the lives of drag queens, athletes and mediums, spent time in coffee shops and haunted places around Gainesville to create their own equations for energy.
