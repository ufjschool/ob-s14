Back in high school, you probably learned equations and forms of energy. A bunch of letters, exponents and fractions somehow come together to equal how things in our lives move.

Kinetic energy equals 1/2mv^2 (Make that an exponent, please! These sentences are not actually part of the ed note)

Potential energy equals m · g · h

For Orange & Blue, energy equals 20 students plus everything we've learned during our years studying at the University of Florida journalism school. We came together this semester to make a magazine exploring energy beyond what’s in a Physics textbook. A talented core of writers, editors, designers and photographers delved into the lives of drag queens and athletes, and spent time in coffee shops and haunted places to create their own energy equations.

Staff writer Katina Prokos features the Mischievous Madams Burlesque Troupe in Gainesville. Dancers like Maressa Fox and Stella O’Hare inspire by letting go of their inhibitions. Photographer Yaissy Solis documents the festive atmosphere that takes over every month in various Gainesville clubs. This feature is one of many that re-define what it means to move.
