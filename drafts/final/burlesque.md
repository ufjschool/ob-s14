#The Mischievous Madams Bring Sexy Back

Warm, dreamlike light permeates the stage. A sultry woman’s voice melds with jazz, leading the audience down a nostalgic road to a time of martinis and hourglass figures. A raven-haired beauty from another world floats onstage in a scarlet broad-skirted dress, her bright eyes ready to capture the imaginations of the crowd. Before long, she’ll have them in the palm of her hand.

A burlesque performer with the stage name Stella O’Hare removes her intricate costume slowly and deliberately in this Valentine’s Day show. First she uses her teeth to drag her black gloves off her delicate hands, then button-by-button, she unfastens her dress to reveal an ornate red corset.

Basking in the glow of the audience’s cheers, she savors each moment she gets to discard a piece of her carefully assembled lingerie.

Down to a lacy red-and-black bra and panty set, she conceals her body with large, white feathered fans. A carefully choreographed dance teases the audience with glimpses of her thigh or waist. She connects with her audience, looking people in the eyes and beckoning them until the crowd is frenzied.

As the music crescendos, the moment everyone has been waiting for arrives. She shows (almost) all in a pair of heart-shaped pasties and a sparkling thong. For O’Hare, however, the end result is the least important part of the performance.

“People who don’t understand it will say ‘Oh, you’re just taking your clothes off. You’re just stripping,’” she said, “but that’s not what burlesque has to be. It’s not like, I’m just going to take off my clothes and grind in your face for tip money. We’re putting on a show, putting on a performance for their entertainment.”

O’Hare is one of seven women who enchant on a monthly basis in the Mischievous Madams burlesque troupe. Manager Stephen Tierney and founding members Aurora Bootyalis and Whiskey Chase formed the troupe in April 2013 as the first burlesque-only troupe in Gainesville. With shows on average every month, the Madams bring this classic style of performance to the community and have fun doing it.

“We want to give Gainesville a good representation of what burlesque is and can be,” O’Hare said.

Derived from the Italian word “burla” meaning joke or mockery, burlesque is a form of variety show popular first in England and then the United States in the late 19th- and early 20th centuries that came to focus mainly on female striptease. After experiencing practically dying out in the 1970s, a new generation inspired by the glamour and spectacle of the past have revived it during the last 20 years for a mainly female audience. For performers and enthusiasts, burlesque is a liberating form of self-expression best described as sexy, not sexual.

“None of us are doing this for anyone else,” said one Mischievous Madam, who goes by Della Darling. "I feel like I can do anything. You’re totally vulnerable onstage, but you’re also controlling what happens.”

The concept of the act is at the discretion of the performer and can be anything from dance-focused to scary or funny.

The troupe’s only blonde, Jenny Castle, lit up the stage when she shot sparks off her metal panties at a rock-and-roll-themed show in March. During the troupe’s one-year anniversary show on April 12, she hobbled around with a cane in men’s clothing before busting a move as the character of the previous performer’s grandfather.

"I used to always think I needed to be so good, but now I realize I really enjoy being funny. I’ve gotten into clowning and comedy, and I realized I enjoy that more and have a talent for that," Castle said. "We all do something different."

Maressa Fox is another one of the Madams and founder of the Manic Menagerie Vaudeville Company, featuring classic burlesque and other ‘20s-style variety show acts. Since she began pursuing a career as a professional burlesque performer and entertainment manager, she has improved her craft by following advice she got from male burlesque performer Paco Fish:

“When an audience comes to a burlesque show they want one thing, and that’s not tits, it’s not ass. They want to get to know you,” Fox said.

A tall, slender red head, Fox loves burlesque for its therapeutic effects on her body image. Fox has multiple sclerosis, an extremely painful disease inhibiting her movement and causing her to feel like she has a sunburn and sore muscles, so the pleasure of hearing the audience applaud her body grants her a reprieve, even if for a few minutes.

“I’m not very fond of my body in general because when it’s the cause of most of your problems you don’t tend to like it very much, but burlesque is all a celebration of your body,” Fox said. “People are cheering for your body and celebrating you because they think you’re beautiful. That’s really important to me. It’s like a very, very temporary escape from feeling like I’m trapped in the cage of my body.”

Another Mischievous Madam whose stage name is Lillie de Luna also found peace with her physical form when burlesque came into her life as the mother of a 3-year-old.

“Having a baby changes the way you feel about your body,” she said. “It has affected me a lot with my body image issues because this troupe especially has a pretty wide variety of ladies.”

Burlesque has a reputation for embracing all body shapes, sizes and ages, like curvy sensation Miss Dirty Martini or the legendary redhead Tempest Storm, who is now 86 and was still performing in Las Vegas in the early 2000s. Being a great performer is a matter of charisma and not physical perfection.

Other troupe members say they are naturally shy but burlesque gives them a chance to come out of their shells.

“It’s like I’m a completely different person when I get onstage,” O’Hare said. “Up until the very last second when I get onstage I’m freaking out, but when we get onstage and everyone cheers it’s this adrenaline rush that’s like nothing else.”

With no former performing experience, troupe member Formaldehyde Flower found herself drawn to burlesque not only as accepting of all kinds of women but also a good way for an introvert to meet new people. With gothic style that blends beauty with darkness, she brands herself as Gainesville’s spooky sweetheart. Her fantastical acts transport the audience with characters like a witch doctor and the Cheshire Cat.

“When I put together an act, what I’m doing is creating a temporary world for myself and my audience," Flower said. "We exist somewhere else. This is not real life anymore."

With so much anticipation for the clothes to come off in a strip tease, the audience may not realize how much work goes into creating the elaborate costumes. The Madams cultivate a do-it-yourself culture by making these together at the weekly “stitch and bitch,” where they meet at someone’s house to work on their next ensembles and share what’s happening in their lives over rind stones, hot glue and wine.

They turn household items into props and bedazzle old shoes and lingerie to give costumes that desired sparkle. Dita Von Teese, currently the world’s most iconic burlesque star known for her girl in the glass act, has her set pieces encrusted with Swarovski crystals. Costumes can get expensive quickly if a performer doesn’t use at least some home-made pieces.

“The quote in the industry is ‘the difference between strip club stripping and burlesque is in strip club stripping you’re making $300 in a $30 outfit while in burlesque you’re making $30 in a $300 outfit,'” Flower said.

Like conceptualizing the act, creating the costumes is a labor of love for the Madams. While they may get different things out of performing, each Mischievous Madam has had her life changed for the better by discovering burlesque. Bravely completing a strip tease for an audience of friends and strangers has given each of them a boost of confidence and a chance to connect with themselves as well as the audience.

"(The acts) are all small parts of me I don’t express outwardly," said Mischievous Madam Sally Sucre. "I am kind of shy, so it’s not typical for me to just kind of take off my clothes in front of people I don’t know. The first time I did it, it was just so empowering and enthralling that I didn’t even care how many people were there or how many people weren’t."
