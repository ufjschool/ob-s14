Michael Thomas Stevens truly lives off the grid. He likes it that way. He’s impossible to contact. His only interviews online are to alternative websites. Heck, he doesn’t even go by Michael. He prefers Mycol (more on that later).

It’s a coup to arrange an interview with this self-described child of the woods who lived in suburban Cleveland as a child and attended high school in Sarasota, Fla., and now has a homestead in Brooker, Fla. where the sun and the birds are his morning alarm. 

Photographer Bakr Muhammad and I depart from a Gainesville, Fla., apartment complex at 8:30 a.m. for a March 29 meeting at Steven’s Finca Mycol farm. That’s Mycol’s Farm in Spanish. We don’t know what to expect. All I have is information gathered from telephone interviews with Alachua County librarian Pat Griggs, Alachua County Commissioner Mike Byerly and the President of Pure Energy Solar, Wayne Irwin. All of whom generate their own power independent of Gainesville Regional Utilities, which powers the progressive college town.

Griggs laughs as he remembers hurricane season nine years ago. Any Floridian knows the feeling. Storm comes. Damage ensues. Power dies. Life stops. Mundane acts become daily struggles. Hurricanes like Katrina, Rita and Wilma created a living hell in 2005. 

“During that period of time, I was very popular with my neighbors,” he says of that year.

For Griggs, assistant librarian for the Alachua County Library, hurricane season doesn’t mean a departure from normalcy. He’s lived off the grid for 22 years. He generates his own electricity from a four-inch well that pumps water with a 12-volt solar-powered pump and pressurizes it to his house.

Byerly and his wife Busy Shires Byerly built their solar home in Micanopy, Fla., three years ago with the environment in mind. They worked with a contractor to build a house equipped with solar power capabilities. Byerly remembers arguing with a GRU worker, walking along his street, debating which trees to ultimately cut down for a power line. He decided against tying into GRU in order to keep the trees.

A completely off-the-grid home, with eight golf cart energy units in the basement, resulted, but one would never know looking at the house. Normal appliances sit throughout on countertops. Cupolas adorn the high ceilings.

Finca Mycol is no normal place.

The navigation system in my Honda 2007 CR-V reads 30 minutes, but judging by the surroundings it’s much longer. Three solar panels ironically sit in the field of Westwood Middle School on 34th street. The road veers off to the right about 10 minutes later as businesses disappear and pine trees emerge along the two-lane State Road 231. Cell phone service goes out. An armadillo, still fresh, lies off to the side.

The cement turns into a dirt road straight from a Wes Craven movie. University Avenue at the University of Florida represents First Avenue. Finca Mycol is in the 200s. 

Brooker, Fla., has a population of 338 people and an area of 319 acres, according to the 2010 Census. That doesn’t even cover the distance around the UF campus.

Bakr and I find the narrow left turn and look for the welcome sign that Stevens described over the phone a day earlier. No sign. I spot his mailbox. We park the car under a canopy of trees and start walking. 

Finca Mycol greets us with a 4-by-4 sign reading "Welcome" in four different languages. Vines ensnare an old American truck under an overarching oak tree. It’s a foreboding scene. The once-powerful truck falls victim to the forest. We keep walking.

A work area, with a metal roof, wooden support beams and no walls, is straight ahead where Brian Conner, 27, and Jameson Burnette, 28, are working in what appears to be a kitchen. Stevens approaches from a tiny hut adjacent to the area.

He’s not rocking the dreadlocks from a 2011 story in the alternative publication Elephant Journal. He’s got a graying beard that’s a cross between George Clooney and Tom Hanks in “Castaway. He’s rocking a fading red button down shirt with black geometric shapes in no particular pattern. He’s wearing olive green cargo shorts to go along with his black Crocs. And he’s eating a banana.

I begin asking questions. Goats call in unison. Birds chirp. It’s not yet 10 a.m. One goat call in particular doesn’t sound right. A bubbly woman in her mid-20s comes towards us from a walking trail. That’s Kricket, Stevens’ girlfriend with certainly an interesting greeting from the two. Rain falls. My notebook and recorder get wet. Kricket offers me a black umbrella.

I’m a college student who hadn’t thought of self-sustainable living before taking on the story. Stevens is a UF graduate with a Masters at UF’s Howard T. Odum Center for the Wetlands. He's an expert about living on his own.

Stevens grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, where smokestacks dot the skies. Cleveland is an industrial city—a symbol of pure Americana when such a thing existed during the manufacturing boom of the 1950s.  It, along with Ohio’s other “big eight” cities, started as an automotive power until dabbling in other sectors such as medical research. Hard economic times led to a 17.1 percent population decrease from 10 years earlier in 2010. Ironically, Cleveland exposed Stevens to his first experience with nature.

He lived with middle child syndrome. Not coddled enough like the first born and not paid as much attention to as the new baby. Stevens loved it. He explored. He wandered. He discovered.

Stevens found an old small-scale farm as a child roaming the woods near his house. The deserted farm was his jungle gym. He made a fort. He grew fresh plums, apples and concord grapes. He was in “hog heaven” getting his hands dirty from black walnuts. He honed his craft.

His Conservative family moved to Sarasota, Fla., when Stevens turned 13. Stevens studied at UF from 1994-1999 where he served as President of the Wetlands club and as a resident assistant for Fletcher Hall. He wanted more from college than getting good grades, partying and getting laid. Stevens sees potential from college students. The UF Sustainability Club visited Finca Mycol a week before I got there.

“You go to the University of Florida like I did. I was in the football games. I had fun going to them, but I imagine like 50,000 people going out into the environment and doing something with the energy they have when they wear the orange and blue,” Stevens says. 

“Nobody gives a shit about the environment. Especially the youth, because we’re so disconnected with our hyper little phones. Nobody gives a shit about growing food. You just go buy plastic processed products.” 

I point out that I’m using a plastic digital recorder as we’re talking. He calls it appropriate technology and says he uses a laptop, drives to the supermarket and uses Kricket’s cell phone. He recently bought materials to brew his own beer. Stevens continues recounting his journey to Finca.

“I graduate college so what am I going to do? Well, I tried to save the world,” Stevens says. “I tried to teach about having natural systems, so we can clean up all this waste. Then, I got really sick.”

He contracted dysentery and giardia taking a year off in Guatemala and Nicaragua. Stevens returned to Gainesville in 2002, purchasing 20 acres of land for $42,000. He picked up work with Florida Wildlife Control dealing with forest fires and started renting out his place in St. Augustine, Fla., to supplement his small income. He built Finca Mycol from a trash dump. Dilapidated sheds got new life from recycled materials.

“Instead of survivalism, I’m doing thrivalism. What we’re doing is thrivalism,” Stevens says using a term a friend coined. “We’re kicking ass, having fun and living a more enriching life.”

It’s clear talking to Stevens that he isn’t about making a statement. He isn’t a tree-hugging liberal. He hasn’t voted in the last two Presidential elections. He wishes the media would promote a Green Party candidate. He’s just a dude who lives on a farm.

That kicking ass attitude is a fragment of Gainesville’s culture. Finca Mycol is in nearby Bradford County, but anything within a half-hour of Gainesville falls under its hypothetical umbrella to me.

Byerly, a Democrat, noticed the environmentally focused mindset even before getting elected Alachua County Commissioner in 2000. 

“College towns tend to be a little more politically progressive. The history of Gainesville has always had a strong counterculture scene going back to the '50s and '60s. It also is a government town,” Byerly says. “It’s a place where there are a lot of federal and state government installations. We have a highly educated diverse citizenry and progressive politics.”

Gainesville Regional Utilities, or GRU, brought the city national attention with the nation’s first solar Feed-in-Tariff program on Feb. 5, 2009. Byerly, as an Alachua County Commissioner, didn’t have any involvement in the plan. Gainesville county commissioners suspended the program this year. 

It modeled itself after the successful FiT plans in Europe where companies bid on solar energy contracts, generate electricity and sell excess power back to the power utility. In theory, it would be a boon for Gainesville. In practice, it was the ‘ole college try.

The tariff was designed to supersede an expected power shortage. It also intended to minimize costs, promote energy-efficient practices and create jobs, according to a Harvard study. That didn’t happen for several reasons. The study outlined one key issue of out-of-state companies bidding on larger contracts, which took up too much of the allotted power and cash payouts intended for Gainesville citizens who could only muster smaller bids. Big money ended up killing the pioneer program in an industry that has gained traction in the city.

“The feed-in-tariff I thought was a great way to encourage and incentivize solar use and production, and disperse some of GRU’s energy production to off grid instead of burning coal or biomass,” Byerly says. “It was of negligible cost to the taxpayers and really expanded production of solar energy in the Gainesville area. There’s some job growth in the industry in that area now. I’m sorry to hear that they’re not continuing that.”

Stevens doesn’t have to worry about bureaucratic bologna. He represents one end of the off-the-grid spectrum. He’s not doing it in preparation for Armageddon. He’s strictly about environmental preservation. Many people like my family, especially in today’s buzzword crazy culture, have some sort of solar panel on their roof generating power to eventually decrease utility costs. It’s solar-grid tied.

Byerly, Griggs and Irwin are independent of GRU, but still use more energy than Stevens, who’s independent of just about everybody. He hasn’t had working electricity at Finca Mycol for seven to eight years. Volunteers come and go helping him tend to the compound's various problems. They come mainly from the Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, which pair volunteers with host farms. Stevens could write a book of the mistakes he’s made. They don’t teach off-the-grid living in schools.

I ask Stevens why he goes to such great lengths for his energy independence. Aside from his younger sister, his family members have deemed him too far out of the way to visit. He can go the energy-efficient, fluorescent light bulb route with all the cliché “green practices.” He can adopt the off-the-grid practices of somebody like Byerly. He chooses not to. The original $42,000 has paid itself off over and over.

That’s not why though. He takes me to another living quarters that doubles as his office. There’s a chalkboard that lists his “daily thangs” to do. There’s a mattress on the floor and a small van connected to the outdoor room.

He points to a black and white poster tacked to the wall. Stevens purchased the poster at a talk given by the Beehive Collective at Gainesville’s Civic Media Center. The group verbosely describes itself as a “wildly motivated, all-volunteer, activist arts collective dedicated to cross-pollinating the grassroots by creating collaborative, anti-copyright images for use as educational and organizing tools,” on its website.

The poster depicts a forest overtaken by industry, with semis extracting coal atop a mountain, factories blowing smoke in the background and an industrialized city mitigating the damage by carrying out cliché green practices. To some, celebrating Earth Day is enough, but that’s just the beginning for Stevens.

“It totally explains in this one picture why I freaking hate this coal train that goes by here. This is what’s happening here,” Stevens says. “You have the extractors doing mountaintop removal and fucking up the mountains. We’re so disconnected from that. Nobody ever sees that.”

I still hadn’t seen his power bank and figured I'd ask. I was curious to see how Stevens stacks up to other off-the-gridders. He and I trudge in the rain that’s turned my blue Nike Frees into clay messes. March 29, at 0.67 in., had the fifth-most precipitation for Gainesville during the month. 

We continue walking. We pass his chicken coop. The smell of a petting zoo meets me as we approach a redesigned Volkswagon van. Three goats move around the pen that uses the van as shade. There’s Penelope, Elvis and Unicorn. Stevens call them his dogs. They’re wearing bamboo triangles around their neck to prevent them from skipping town. 

A Lienenkugel’s Sunset Wheat beer bottle rests in the dirt. It came from a molded wall on the side of the van where beer bottles act as artificial light reflecting off the sun. Perhaps the goats were thirsty. 

I walk into a gated area of the pen where six car batteries are connected to wires going in every which direction to power cell phones, run lights, charge computers and run small fans. This is Finca Mycol’s heart. I knew Stevens only used electricity for charging electronics at best, but putting the camp’s power supply in a goat pen?

“If you’re going to have your big ‘ole wants and not needs, then you’re going to have to have a huge system. Here this is maybe a $500 system,” Stevens says. 

An airplane propeller collects dust in a top shelf. It will be a wind turbine. Why do people need a bigger system? 

“You get these nice toys and we’re spoiled. You want to be like the Joneses," he says. "You always want to be bigger and better. The typical America way I guess.”

The Mycol Stevens way is a simple one. Focus on perma culture, planting more than one crop, being as independent as possible and spreading the gospel when asked. Stevens repeatedly rails on the 500-acre lot next door that practices monoculture. Only growing one crop is financially lucrative at first until the harvest gets sick and chemicals are needed to fix the problem. This costs money and hurts the environment.

He created the Florida Earthskills Gathering, which is a seminar dedicated to teaching self-sustaining skills. It’s a four-day workshop of overnight revelry and intensive learning. He hosts educational field trips at the farm where children get away from the concrete playground of Disney World and into the world of nature. Stevens teaches at the Florida Herbalism Conference and the Hostel in the Forest.

Stevens tells me as we venture from the pen to his pond that he prefers Mycol to his birth name Michael. Those scientifically inclined might recognize that mycol comes from mycology, which is the study of mushrooms. He rattles off scientific names. All I know are portabella and psychedelic.

With the rain stopping, he picks up a green leaf. It looks like any normal leaf. He smells it, then identifies it as Chenopodium Ambrosoides. In other words, a Mexican Tea leaf. 

He must really know his stuff now, I think to myself. Our time together dies down, as does the rain. Bakr trails behind me snapping photos. Suddenly, lightning and thunder force us into a brisk walk and then a run into his living quarters. 

I put away my notebook once inside. I want to listen to the knowledge. I want to hear more stories about black bears, duck, deer, otters and skunks venturing onto the property. He opens a botany book to a page on earambola, which is science talk for a central China plant. His favorite read is the famous ethno-botany book “One River,” by Wade Davis. Between tending to his farm and dealing with electrical issues, there isn’t much free time. He doesn’t spend it watching "House of Cards." He reads botany books.

He reveals that he was a nuclear power operator in the Navy for six years and likes how environmentally friendly nuclear energy is when done right. This man, at 44, is full of stories. I’m exhausted.

“We need a revolution. I ain’t doing it,” Stevens says. “I’m just providing an alternative way of living.”

Bakr and I head to the car as the rain subsides. I enjoyed the hour-and-a-half at Finca Mycol. I learned about one off-the-grid option that provided perspective as well. If Stevens shies away from technology and outside communication, I sure as heck can wean off my iPhone.

We’re driving on the dirt road when I spot a massive tree that fell over during the storm. It’s blocking our path. I make a left around the tree. There’s no road for me to drive on. We’re not moving.

My left tire is stuck in the mud. I instinctively push on the gas only to dig us deeper in this muddy mess. I whip out my iPhone to call a tow truck. No service. Great. Having spent the morning with Stevens, I ask myself what he’d do in this situation. I laugh. He’d just take care of it himself. Bakr, leaning on the hood, pushes the car back. I step on the gas. He gets into the car. We start driving home.
