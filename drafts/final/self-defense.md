#Rape Aggression Defense Program Lets Women Call the Shots

Hulking toward her in the darkness, the faceless aggressor takes many forms.

For one woman, he is the high school football player she couldn’t push away at age 16. For another, he represents not one person but the three boys who surrounded her and beat her up one night in middle school. For most, he is an unknown attacker who may not exist but haunts her imagination, always close behind in a parking lot.

“Stop!” they yell, somewhat startled by their own voices at first. They muster more confidence to shout “stay back!” before kicking his groin or striking hard at his face. They make a run for the door, and the experience is over as quickly as it began.

The participants in UFPD's Rape Aggression Defense Program (RAD) are never really alone, though, nor in any danger. The aggressors are actually police officers in protective padding who simulate attacks for the women while certified RAD self-defense instructors stay near to yell suggestions and make sure no one gets hurt. The supportive voices of fellow self-defense students cheer them on from the sidelines.

RAD is the world’s largest network of self-defense programs designed for women. RAD instructors have taught more than 900,000 women the basics of personal safety and hands-on techniques since the program was founded in 1989, according to its website.

UFPD’s program is unlike most. It is funded completely by the police department, which allowed 437 women in the campus community to take the basic course last year for free. UFPD will begin offering self-defense classes for men this year.

Women can register for a series of four classes that takes place over two weeks. Following an informational overview of risk reduction and avoidance, the course progresses to learning and practicing moves such as blocking, hitting and kicking. The participants put their skills to the test on the final night by escaping three increasingly difficult attack simulations.

The course goes beyond teaching women practical techniques to convincing participants of their own strength and capability. Many notice a dramatic change in their self-confidence in day-to-day life.

Danna Regnier, 21, couldn’t walk anywhere alone without remembering being bullied and beat up as a girl in China. The UF sophomore and Innovation Academy student decided it was time to change that by taking the RAD course and found herself reliving those experiences during simulations.

“I thought I was going to pass out the moment I stepped in the door,” Regnier said.

After struggling to find her voice, Regnier fought back and kept fighting to successfully escape each scenario. Those victories have given her the confidence to walk with her chin up from now on.

“I used to be afraid of just being by myself walking on the street,” Regnier said. “You can hear it in my voice. I’m not afraid of going out anymore.”

Sydney Richardson, 20, had a similar experience of finding new self-assurance after completing the course on April 2. The third-year UF digital arts and sciences student was walking home on campus recently when she noticed a car was following her with the passenger recording her on his smartphone.

UF psychology freshman Laura Bautista, 18, found herself on her own for the first time as she started college and her parents moved from her hometown of Miami to Texas. She decided to take the course to give her some peace of mind.

“It’s really different to be kind of on your own and no one is really looking out,” Bautista said. “If I don’t show up, no one’s going to really wonder. They’re going to think I’m at a friend’s or something.”

Many first-year females find themselves in a similar situation due to a lifetime of being told to rely on external sources to ensure their personal safety. They've been told to stay with someone else, preferably a trusted man, or keep a dog or gun.

“As a woman, you’re constantly reminded you’re weak or not physically strong. You’re constantly in your mind a potential target for violence,” said Tina Lamb, state director for RAD programs in Florida and program coordinator for UFPD. “Once you gain confidence in that area, then it just kind of overflows into every other part.”

After taking the course, Bautista said she plans to return to improve her self-defense skills but feels more comfortable being alone.

“When I’m walking alone, there are things that come to mind like what I should be doing and what I should be looking out for now,” Bautista said. “The circumstances haven’t really changed, but it’s me that’s changed so I can approach things a little better.”

Lamb, 32, has never been a victim of violence herself, but she also felt in constant danger until RAD came into her life in 2003.

"Before I took the class, I was a fraidycat,” she said. “Especially living on my own in college, when I thought about the possibility of facing violence, it was almost a foregone conclusion in my mind that I couldn’t stop it.”

The Gainesville native had no experience with self-defense, fighting or martial arts before she took the RAD course with a co-worker as part of training for her first full-time job at the UF Department of Student Financial Affairs, where she began working after graduating from UF with a bachelor’s degree in classical studies.

Lamb loved the class so much that she convinced the other women in her department to take the course too. Her enthusiasm for the program spread to her husband, Sgt. Jeffrey Lamb of the UPD Community Services Division, who was an officer at the time. Having known Tina for 12 years, Jeffrey has seen firsthand how RAD changed his wife.

“She is a completely different person after becoming involved with RAD,” he said. “She’s more self-confident, she’ll stand up for herself, she’ll tell people what her expectations are and she is not shy when it comes to her personal safety.”

The couple became certified as instructors in 2007, and Jeffrey was the program coordinator for UFPD from 2007 to 2010. With Tina currently serving as UFPD program coordinator and state director, Jeffrey now contributes by playing the role of the aggressor.

Since becoming state director in July 2012, Tina Lamb has focused on supporting newer RAD programs elsewhere in North Central Florida, helping them get the equipment, instructional help and funds they need to expand in their areas. This tight-knit group of instructors is from Chiefland, Tampa and the Suwannee River Valley area.

For example, child advocate Morgan Bright has been a RAD instructor for a little more than a year and has run the Ocala program almost entirely with borrowed equipment and help from instructors in neighboring cities. The Ocala Police Department provided Bright with a room and training mat, but the department decided in February to begin funding the program with Bright as coordinator.

“I’m going to be sad that I won’t see everybody as often because we’re a pretty tight-knit group,” Bright said, referring to the other regional instructors. “I’ve gotten such a great response from the community, though. It’s been amazing.”

Having secretly experienced two sexual assaults in high school, Bright was encouraged to take the RAD class by her mother when she started college at University of South Florida. During attack simulations on the final night of the course, she was unprepared for the triggers that would bring those memories back. Finding herself in tears, she got help from a victim advocate who was present.

It took three years for Bright to feel comfortable enough to return to the RAD class, but today she appreciates that it forced her to confront what had happened and move on with her life.

“RAD has been my therapy, the only time I worked through the emotions, because I didn’t have to say anything,” Bright said. “I hit something and it’s pretty nice.”

For women who have survived acts of violence, taking the R.A.D. course can be as therapeutic as it is practical. 

Part of being an instructor is observing the women in class to see if they are uncomfortable or need encouragement because of a past incident, Lamb said.

“Some women will never need to be there because of the class,” Lamb said. “For others who have been there it gives them a victory, some confidence to move forward and help put down that emotional burden they’ve been carrying around.”

The effects of the program on the women extend well beyond a physical altercation. Women who have received self-defense training have been shown to be more assertive in the workplace, more self-confident and less anxious overall, according to a University of Illinois at Springfield review of 20 studies on the subject.

“It’s changed a lot about the way I carry myself and work and all kinds of things,” Lamb said. “I used to not be very assertive and used to be pretty passive, and now I pretty much say whatever I think, whenever I want.”
