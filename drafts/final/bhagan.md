The all-nighter – a rite of passage that’s part of the college experience. As hard as student may try to avoid staying up all night before a major exam, they still find themselves find themselves up during the early morning hours chugging caffeine to get themselves through the studying the need to get done.
According to GatorWell, seven to 10 hours of sleep are ideal for staying healthy and energized.  Despite the research, students still succumb to the need to stay up all night to study for an exam or write a research paper last minute, and they have different methods of beating the drowsiness.
Sarah Gaies does not like to stay awake all night studying, but she said it does happen.  Gaies, a 20-year-old health science sophomore said that the latest she’s ever stayed up because of school is until 8:30 a.m. because she had to write a paper. 
Gaies said she never acquired a taste for coffee and didn’t like the artificial taste of energy drinks, describing them as “plastic-y.”  Instead, the health science sophomore said she eats chocolate.
“This is weird, but I like to eat to chocolate,” Gaies said.  “It keeps me awake, and I like having it as a reward.”
Jane Emmerée, a health promotion specialist at GatorWell, listed a few of the effects of bad sleeping habits including diabetes, blood pressure problems and a weakened immune system. It is also affects relationships by making people more irritable and safety on the road because tiredness affects driving abilities.
Consuming caffeine can have adverse affects on sleeping patterns in general, according to GatorWell.  Coffee contains anywhere between 100-350 mg. of caffeine.  Chocolate has about 8 mg. per ounce.  Even pain relievers like Midol can have caffeine in them and affect sleep.
Emmerée said she knows it can be difficult to break the habit of staying up all night to study for exams.
“It takes a leap of faith,” Emmerée said.  “Start with an exam or project that doesn’t have as many consequences.”	
Virginia Somers, a UF graduate student, said she had really bad study habits as an undergraduate student.  The 23-year-old veterinary medicine major said she would avoid coffee because she hated the taste.  Her typical choice for a caffeine jump-start was Mountain Dew.  If she really needed to pull a traditional all-nighter, she would depend on 5-hour ENERGY to get her through the day.
Emmerée said that a common myth among the general population is that people can make up the sleep they’ve lost.  She said more and more research is showing this is not true because we incur a sleep debt, and it’s not that easy to catch up.
Another myth, Emmerée said, is that sleep deprivation doesn’t affect health.
“Sleep should be as important as healthy eating and exercise in your life,” Emmerée said. “As important as your social life.”
Emmerée said that having a regular routine for sleep is as important as getting enough sleep.
“Students tell me they stay up till 3 or 4 [a.m.] on Fridays because they’re socializing,” Emmerée said.  “I’m not telling you to be rigid.” 
Emmerée said that is an advocate for naps, but people need to look at their reasons for taking naps.  They should be supplemental rather than a replacement for a good night’s rest.  Naps also shouldn’t be too long – an hour or more is too much.
“Napping may be a symptom of a poor sleep foundation,” she said. “Are you doing it because you’re exhausted?  Or because you had a rough week?” 
As a graduate student, Somers said she has learned from her past mistakes and tries to avoid staying up all night and having to take the 5-hour ENERGY drinks.
“It tastes really bad,” Somers said. “It’s really sour and tastes like the fluoride you get when you go to the dentist and cough syrup.”
She said 5-hour ENERGY was always effective at keeping her awake for the full five hours, but it made her crash afterward.  She said better study habits and trips to the gym have been better at keeping her energy level up.
Emmerée said a good night’s sleep can come from doing something relaxing and winding down before bed.  She said it’s different for everyone.  For some people listening to relaxing music helps.  For others, it’s using guided imagery to picture a place that’s relaxing.
Emmerée said studies have shown a relationship between light and sleepiness, which is why people should avoid being in front of a screen, whether it’s a phone, computer or tablet, for at least 30 minutes before going to bed.
“A strong, healthy sleep foundation is important for doing well in classes, relationships and life,” Emmerée said.  “It influences all aspects of life.”
