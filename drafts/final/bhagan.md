The all-nighter: a rite of passage that’s part of the college experience. As hard as students may try to avoid staying up all night before a major exam, they still find themselves up awake during the early morning hours, chugging caffeine to get through studying.

Seven to 10 hours of sleep are ideal for staying healthy and energized, according to the University of Florida's GatorWell Health Promotion Services. Despite the research, students continue to pull all-nighters to finish up research papers, and they have different methods of beating the drowsiness.

Sarah Gaies doesn't like to stay awake all night studying, but she said it does happen. The 20-year-old said she once stayed up until 8:30 a.m. because she had to write a paper. She never acquired a taste for coffee and doesn't like the artificial taste of energy drinks, describing them as “plastic-y.”  Instead, the health science sophomore prefers to eat chocolate. 
 “It keeps me awake, and I like having it as a reward," she said.

Jane Emmerée, a health promotion specialist at GatorWell, listed a few of the effects of bad sleeping habits: diabetes, blood pressure problems, and a weakened immune system. Relationships are also affected by making people more irritable. Safety on the road is at stake too because tiredness affects driving abilities.

Consuming caffeine can have adverse effects on sleeping patterns, in general, according to GatorWell.  Coffee contains anywhere between 100 and 350 mg of caffeine.  Chocolate, on the other hand, has about 8 mg per ounce.  Even pain relievers like Midol can have caffeine in them and affect sleep.

Emmerée said she knows breaking the habit of staying up all night to study for exams can be difficult. 

“It takes a leap of faith,” she said.  “Start with an exam or project that doesn’t have as many consequences.”	

As an undergraduate student, Virginia Somers had poor study habits. The 23-year-old veterinary medicine graduate student said she avoided coffee because she hated the taste.  Her typical choice for a caffeine jump-start was Mountain Dew. If she was in dire need of a traditional all-nighter, she would depend on 5-hour ENERGY to get her through the day.

Emmerée said a common myth among the general population is people can make up the sleep he or she lost. More and more research is showing this is not true because we incur a sleep debt, she said, and it’s not that easy to catch up.

Another myth that exists is sleep deprivation doesn’t affect health.

“Sleep should be as important as healthy eating and exercise in your life,” the GatorWell specialist said. “As important as your social life.”

Having a regular routine for sleep is as important as getting enough sleep.

“Students tell me they stay up till 3 or 4 [a.m.] on Fridays because they’re socializing,” Emmerée said.  “I’m not telling you to be rigid.” 

Emmerée is an advocate for naps, but she said people need to look at their reasons for napping. They should be supplemental rather than a replacement for a good night’s rest. Also, naps shouldn’t last for more than an hour. 

“Napping may be a symptom of a poor sleep foundation,” she said. “Are you doing it because you’re exhausted or because you had a rough week?” 

As a graduate student, Somers has learned from her past mistakes. This includes avoiding all-nighters and not drinking 5-hour ENERGY drinks.

“It tastes really bad,” Somers said. “It’s really sour and tastes like the fluoride you get when you go to the dentist and cough syrup.”

She said 5-hour ENERGY was always effective at keeping her awake for the full five hours, but it made her crash afterward. Better study habits and trips to the gym have been better at keeping her energy level up.

Emmerée said a good night’s sleep can come from doing something relaxing and winding down before bed; however, it’s different for everyone. For some people, listening to soothing music helps.  For others, imagining a certain place is soothing.

Studies have shown a relationship between light and sleepiness, Emmerée said. People should avoid being in front of a screen — whether it’s a phone, computer or tablet — for at least 30 minutes before going to bed.

“A strong, healthy sleep foundation is important for doing well in classes, relationships and life,” Emmerée said. “It influences all aspects of life.”
