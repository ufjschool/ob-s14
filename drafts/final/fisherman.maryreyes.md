#Breaking Back: The Uncertain Life of a Fisherman


###Part I: The Man

Beneath the “Parental Advisory” beanie and the rough, black hoodie, the 4 a.m. shadows conceal his coon-eye tan. Andrew Balasis turns the radio dial, drowning out the eerie silence that echoes through the nearly empty streets. The 23-year-old commercial fisherman rises before dawn most days, chasing the horizon in pursuit of fish. He has a feeling today’s trip will be futile. 

“The front came through faster than predicted, and they don’t like that shit to swing to the north too quick,” he says, commenting on the unexpected cold front.

With mackerel season almost over, his chances of making a good catch are slim anyway. After paying for gas, he will most likely lose money on today’s venture.  

If nothing else, at least he’ll be able to send some of his signature Snapchats. His friends receive videos of him jamming out in the car on his early drives, energy drink in hand, almost daily. His job description on Facebook summarizes his straightforward, yet humorous perspective. It reads, “Killing animals at Atlantic Ocean.” His winning sense of humor helps him endure the backbreaking work of his profession. 

“If I had to describe him in one word, I’d say he’s a badass,” said Luis Muniz, Andrew’s friend of nearly 10 years. “He’s the hardest worker I know.” 

The two met when Luis, who lived in the same development, wandered over to his street. When he first saw Andrew playing outside with his stepbrother, Alex, he thought Andrew was younger and initiated conversation with Alex first. He later discovered that Andrew is actually six years Alex’s senior and one year his own, but his height gave him a youthful appearance. Once he realized they were the same age, they became fast friends.

Since the beginning of their friendship, the two wreaked havoc without even trying. One of Luis’ earlier memories of Andrew happened when their neighbor and mutual friend, Scott, cleaned out his pool filter. Scott took off the filter’s grate, leaving a powerful, gaping hole at the bottom of the pool. A dare led Andrew to swim down and place his rear end over it. Apparently, he underestimated its strength.

“We had to jump in the pool,” recalled Luis. “Scott and I had to grab him by his arms and pull as hard as we could, and he had a giant hickey on his ass.”

To elaborate on the size of the massive welt it left behind – no pun intended – Scott added, “His ass had what looked like the world’s largest hickey, like a one foot diameter circle.” 

Anyone who knows Andrew thinks nothing of that story. A natural daredevil, he boasts quite of few astonishing tales, and being a fisherman only adds to the excitement. 


###Part II: The Journey

A typical day begins before sunrise. Once the alarm goes off, there’s no time to waste. To be a fisherman, one cannot be overly fond of sleep. Andrew usually blasts music on the 15-minute ride from his home in Palm Beach Gardens to Jupiter, where he keeps his boat, Miss Ellie. Lana del Ray keeps him company on the journey. He nods his head to the music, matching the slightly melancholy pace of “Radio,” one of his favorite songs. Then a more upbeat song blares from the speakers, drowning out any remnants of sleep still lingering in the air. The day has officially commenced.   

Once he arrives at the storage yard, it’s time to hitch Miss Ellie to the back of his pickup truck. Today, he makes idle conversation with his new audience. 

“Why does my left hand work better? It should be my right hand when I’m right handed,” he observes as he cranks the handle. 

Most days, he works in solitude, the squeaking of the handle responding to his unuttered thoughts before he jumps back into the truck and drives away. 

Andrew needs fuel at the next stop, for Miss Ellie and for himself.  Luckily, the gas station sits adjacent to a Dunkin’ Donuts. He fills up the tank, transfers his equipment from the truck to the boat in preparation for the day’s work, and picks up an orange Gatorade. The restaurant has just opened by the time he finishes. He orders a medium coffee and nothing more- just enough to give him a boost before heading to his final destination. 

At the ramp, he makes the transformation from man to fisherman, clipping on his overalls and pulling on his tough rubber boots. He jumps into the truck one last time – backing up, backing up, backing up – the boat and the water inch closer together, like two lovers expectantly awaiting a kiss, until they touch. Miss Ellie and the ocean reunite. 


###Part III: The Ocean
He steers the boat slowly at first. The undisturbed surface of the water ripples as it approaches. But soon, he picks up speed. The fact that it’s mid-February means it’s almost the end of mackerel season. He makes the majority of his income in the winter, when he nets mackerel and mullet, so he needs to take advantage of this opportunity.    

“Fishin’ for a living isn’t a guaranteed paycheck every week, it’s usually feast or famine,” he says.  “Fishing is a seasonal trade, but the weather is your boss most of the time.” 

Once he’s ventured far enough from shore, he makes his first throw of the day, spinning 360 degrees. The net hits the water with a splash. Andrew uses microfilament webbing. He prefers microfilament to multifilament because its thin, sheer quality makes it nearly undetectable to fish. Each net possesses different characteristics based on the type of fish being targeted. For mackerel fishing, the webbing can be anywhere from 2 □(7/8) to 3 □(1/2) depending on the size of the mackerel that day, which is relatively large compared to a sand perch or mullet net. 

The first catch seems sparse. Just a few mackerel scuffle between the gaps in the net. Andrew fishes relatively peacefully for a while, then an unexpected freeloader appears. A seven-foot shark tries to steal fish from the net and becomes ensnared, tearing the net to shreds as it fights to escape.  There goes one net. 

In addition to sharks, Andrew must compete with porpoises and pelicans. Both make appearances throughout the morning, circling the boat in an attempt to take home some mackerel for themselves. People who express their love of dolphins around him can expect him to respond with a list of reasons why they are the most deplorable animals to ever grace the ocean. 

“They’re fuckin’ conniving, motherfucking evil… horrible,” he says of the adorable thieves. 

The sun gradually ascends, illuminating the recycle bin slowly filling with mackerel, their metallic scales casting light as they flop about. By one o’clock, the bin nearly overflows. After several unsuccessful throws, Andrew decides to cut his losses and head ashore. He estimates that he caught slightly more than 100 pounds, a small amount for mackerel, which usually ranges from zero to 3,000 pounds per catch.  Like he said, the weather is his boss. 


###Part IV: The Market

Andrew sells his fish to a wholesale dealer in Port Canaveral called Seafood Atlantic. Their prices vary from week to week and are based on 50 pounds or more of whole fish. Because of his sparse catch and the distance to the dealer, he decides to sell them locally instead. 

The intricate chain functions similarly to a drug cartel. Andrew provides fish to the dealers, who in turn sell it to the clients. Without him, the chain ceases to exist. He stars as Heisenberg in his own version of “Breaking Bad.”

Once he arrives at his destination, he stand in the bed of his truck and places the fish into a large Styrofoam bin filled with ice before the chef wheels the product of Andrew’s hard work into the building. The price of his labor totals just $151, $1 per pound of mackerel. 

One of the drawbacks to being a fisherman is the uncertainty that comes with the profession.  He never knows if the weather, supply and demand, or luck will work in his favor; kind of like Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. He lives in suspense most of the year, awaiting his next big catch.  

###Part V: The Moments of Bliss

The instability of his profession never stops him from living life to the fullest. When he’s not fishing, Andrew hangs out with his friends, expresses his loyalty to Chipotle by ordering a burrito bowl daily, and never misses an opportunity to hug a pretty girl – although, his heart belongs to one lady in particular.  

His love for the sea and pride in being in fisherman is apparent to everyone he encounters – and not simply because of his passion. He sports a Hogfish tattoo on his left forearm and an entire sleeve on his right. Complete with a net, a lobster, the ocean, a kingfish, and a mutton snapper, the vivid scene serves as a visible sign of his love for the sea. 

“Fishing can be very rewarding to someone who enjoys it, but it’s the hardest, most backbreaking work you can imagine,” he says.

Although his days spent fishing bring him happiness, Andrew remains conscious of the things he often sacrifices for the job he loves. Lack of sleep, skin cancer, and the toll it can take on a fisherman’s family life – if he’s lucky enough to have one – are all symptoms of his unquenchable addiction. He works rain or shine, drives all the way to the gulf coast if need be, and never puts sleep first. He even made up a quote to help him cope with the stressful days: “Days of agony for moments of bliss.”

Recently, a cheap shot from a belligerent man left him with a broken jaw. It’s been wired shut for three weeks now, meaning protein shakes and other liquids are his only source of sustenance. Even without solid food in his stomach and a stabbing pain in his face, he continues to fish. But he daydreams about the feast he plans to eat at Chili’s upon the wire’s removal: queso, fajitas, bacon ranch quesadillas, chipotle chicken crispers, and a molten lava cake. And no, he doesn’t intend to share.

He drove to Daytona to fish 30 miles offshore, sleeping only one and a half hours in three days. It’s on those days that he remembers why he became a fisherman – because he hates people, loves being in nature, and sees awesome stuff on a daily basis. 

Though his grueling lifestyle is unpredictable and challenges him physically, mentally, and emotionally, there’s one thing he’s certain about: the sea brings him bliss. He can’t imagine his life without it.

“I won’t ever be able to do anything else. I’ll die a fisherman,” he declares.
