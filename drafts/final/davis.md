##Behind the Mind of an Athlete

Female distance runners from around the country glided down the lanes at New York’s indoor Armory Track. Laura Steel, sidelined with Achilles tendonitis and her University of Pennsylvania jersey packed away in her travel bag, watched in envy – the leanness in their arms and legs, the ease in which they competed, running times she only dreamed of.

“I wanted to know what their secret was,” said Steel, 24, an alumnus of Penn seeking to go to medical school. “I remember thinking, ‘I bet they’re really healthy.’”

That was the start to the mind games. For Steel, her mental battle was an eating disorder. For some collegiate student-athletes, it’s coping with depression after a losing season. For others, it’s completely disintegrating under the pressure to meet high standards in the classroom as well as on the playing field. For many, being a student-athlete at any school becomes about perfectionism, having a never-ending hunger for victory and being hit with a feeling that no one else could ever understand. 

Steel’s athletic and academic career at Penn began in 2008 when she traveled across the country from Jacksonville, Fla., and enrolled as a freshman at the urban Ivy League school, a place where city life and hard work collide.

“The challenging environment made me feel often like I was treading water in a very deep ocean,” she said, “just trying to keep my head above it and not look down.”

A top five runner on the Penn cross-country team as a freshman, Steel had set high standards for herself at the start of her first indoor track season. But when her Achilles left her sidelined from workouts and jumping into a pool to aqua jog, she had little left to keep her mental energy up.

“I didn't even have track to give me some sense of fulfillment,” she said. “During this month or so, I decided I was going to channel that frustration into eating healthy.”

Slowly shedding pounds, Steel began to improve on the track. But eight months later, what had started as good intentions left her with her weight and GPA dropping quickly.

“I didn’t weigh myself everyday, but I knew,” she said. “I would sometimes lie about things to avoid meeting people for meals and was extremely agitated all the time.”

It wasn’t until her roommates made a pancake breakfast that she realized her relationship with food, and with herself, had deteriorated. Something within her told her not to eat – that she wasn’t allowed. At that moment, Steel saw the rules dictating her life and the anxiety choking her.

“I felt cornered and attacked,” she said, “and it took me admitting to myself that I had a problem before any healing could even begin, and that was tough.”

Turning to a friend and former member of the Penn track team, Steel poured out the feelings that had been eating her up for half a year: feelings of inadequacy in her sport, being too self-critical, and above all, feelings of not being good enough. Steel’s friend immediately searched for doctors and specialists who could help her.

“After one year of doctor's appointments, counseling sessions and nutritionist visits, I had gained back enough weight to begin competing,” Steel said. “And those women are the reasons why I want to be a doctor.”

But the road to recovery was by no means easy.

“I was very sneaky,” she said. “Before weigh-ins, I would chug water or wear the thickest sweaters I owned. But [her support team] held me accountable every step of the way.”

And before she made a full-recovery, along with running personal-bests on the track her senior year, she was still labeled “the sick girl.” And labels can have a powerful effect on anyone.

So powerful, in fact, that sports counseling and psychology has only recently become a profession of its own, and many Division I schools have yet to hire a sports counselor directly affiliated with their athletic departments. Why? The negative stigma that comes with counseling could offer one answer.

Jaime Jenkins, a sports counselor affiliated with the University of Florida, didn’t even know her profession existed before coming to UF, where she studied exercise science. Now, with a PhD in mental health counseling, she owns her own private practice in Gainesville and works primarily with UF student-athletes.

“We’re investing a lot more and expecting a lot more of our student athletes,” Jenkins said. “And if we don’t support them to balance that out, we’re going to see more anxiety, more depression.”

Jenkins said she was inspired to pursue a profession in sports counseling by her own experiences as a hurdler on the UF track team.

“Athletes at this level a lot of times are developmentally delayed because they have been spending all of their time training,” she said. “They don’t have the same luxuries as everyone else does to date, go abroad or even to study.”

Jenkins’ office, adorned with comfy couches and decorated with plush pillows, offers students a space to forget about 6 a.m. stadiums, vent about coaches or discuss anything else that they are struggling with and that could potentially be holding them back in their sport. She also meets with them on campus for better convenience.

“If [student athletes] have someone telling them what to do every moment of the day, managing their every minute, and they’re not having any opportunities to explore who they are and what they want, then they need someone to step in and advocate for them,” she said.

For Jenkins, it’s about the person, not the athletic performance.

“They’re not robots,” she said. “They need permission to just be who they are. Anybody who focuses on results or performances as the end all be all is really neglecting the whole process.”

UF employs full-time nutritionists, strength coaches, athletic trainers and doctors to work one-on-one with athletes in all 13 sports, but not a sports counselor. While affiliated with the school, Jenkins only provides a service to UF as an independent contractor. In other words, the university could drop her at any moment with no strings attached. As a result, job security serves as her biggest challenge. 

Nicole Noyes, a PhD student at Indiana University Bloomington, said she believes the answer lies in the stigma attached to the title of “counselor.”

“For a domain that prides itself on toughness, addressing mental health is often seen as grounds for failure or weakness,” she said. “On the contrary, de-stigmatizing mental illness may actually lead to better performance outcomes and greater resources for athletes.”

The psychological tolls elite athletes undergo are rising, and the headlines are reflecting that. Sasha Menu Courey, a swimmer at the University of Missouri, and Madison Holleran, a distance runner at Penn, recently committed suicide, breaking hearts around the country. In an article published in January, ESPN cited data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) that, “Suicide was the third-leading cause of death of student-athletes from 2004-08, after accidents and cardiac causes.”

“[Holleran’s death] really hit home for many of us, because if we did not see ourselves in her shoes, we have close friends who we know felt her same pressures,” said Steel, who graduated Penn the year after Holleran had started her freshman year. “What I hope the younger members of the team can hear is no matter what fight you are fighting, you do not have to fight alone.”

Steel said that her doctor, nutritionist and counselor were the support system that saved her life, and if a school has these resources, more athletes should take advantage of them. Noyes, who competed in crew at Holy Cross University, said she wished she had support resources to help her through her four years as a collegiate student-athlete.

“Sport psychology consultants can make it a point to promote services to coaches and teams,” Noyes said. “But coaching staff and administration need to be willing to actively support and promote this access.”

For Christine Moore, being mentally strong is the backbone to not only her individual athletic success, but also overall team success. As a computer science freshman from Oklahoma, when Moore, 19, isn’t cramming for her next calculus exam, she’s spiking and setting on UF’s sandy beach volleyball courts. Having once been a pressure-driven elite high school player, she now chooses to see the sport as fun rather than solely a competition.

“If I messed up once, I would just shrink into a shell and never come back out and then from there on out I would think everything I did was bad,” she said. “My intensity came off as being rude, and I lost favor in a lot of my teammates’ eyes.” 

Moore looks back at this attitude and calls it her “old self.” And while she’s overcome many mental struggles on the court, they often have a knack for reemerging – something she experienced over spring break while playing a friendly tournament with her boyfriend.

“I wanted to impress him, and I put so much pressure on myself… It really scared me because it showed me that if you stop being mentally tough for just one second, everything can just flood back,” she said.

The pressure to be perfect in every play was something instilled in her by her first coach in eighth grade, who verbally tore her down after every missed pass or set.

“I went home everyday after practice crying,” she said. “It kind of killed my self-esteem and it wasn’t just in the sports aspect, but overall as a person.”

To combat her old-self and overcome in-game perfectionism, she relied heavily on the support of others. The words of her father, which helped her through her middle school days, often echo in her ears: “Work hard and prove her wrong.” And when her high school coach asked her why she put so much pressure on herself if she was doing her best, Moore just shook her head.

“I don’t know why, but that just clicked for some reason,” she said. “When you have coaches yelling at you or frustrations between teammates, the most important thing you can do and the best thing you can do to win is to keep your mental game strong, and I think that’s more important than being physically strong.”

Had she chosen to pursue playing at the collegiate level, Moore said she definitely would have used any sports counseling resources that were available. She looks up to volleyball Olympians like Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings who undergo neurofeedback training in order to combat their own psychological setbacks.

“It’s the third day of the tournament, you’re exhausted and you know you don’t have anything; It comes down to how badly you want it and how deep you’re gonna push,” she said. “I think it’s then that you really find out how mentally tough you are.”

The UF Counseling and Wellness Center provides a “relaxation room” for its patients as well as its student-athletes. Computers stations contain software such as Wild Divine, which is used to teach people how to change physiological aspects of their bodies that may be affecting their mood, or in athletes’ cases, their performance. Such techniques include meditation games, breathing exercises, and learning to monitor heart rate and body temperature.

“[Biofeedback] provides feedback on the neural changes in the body and helps bring it into our cognitive awareness, so that the participant can respond intentionally rather than reactively,” said Jenkins, who had formerly assisted UF students in the biofeedback process. 

While many collegiate and professional athletes undergo feedback training as a way to stay attune with their bodies, reduce stress and enhance performance, Steel never has and may never have to. Right now, she said she’s just enjoying the ride.

In the pitch-black Philadelphia evenings, with only running shoe reflectors as her guide, she sprints hill repeats alongside the other members of the Bryn Mawr Running Company. Preparing for the 2014 Boston Marathon, she enjoys the atmosphere of a new team, new workouts, but above all, a new inspiration.

“When I start to think I’m crazy for choosing to continue training alongside my future career goals, I think about the fact that I am running with all people who make the effort to keep running as a part of their life because it makes them happy,” she said. “I have been so lucky to find role models and supportive friends who have shown me that it can be done.”
