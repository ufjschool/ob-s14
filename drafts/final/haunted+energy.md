####*The rumors, experiences and investigations surrounding haunted legends*

Ghost stories are strange animals. Year after year, you hear them in different voices, see them through different lenses. You can’t prove they exist but can never seem to put a finger on why they don’t. 

Tracing its roots back to before the Civil War, the University of Florida has quite a past. This university has seen world wars and world peace, segregation and integration. It’s seen national championships. And like anything of a great age, this university has seen death. Lots of death.

With death and history comes the inevitable –- the ghost story. 

From haunted elevators to a suicide legend involving one of Tom Petty's most famous songs, these stories live on, passed from class to class. Regardless of whether they actually happened, they are a permanent part of UF history. 

Curious? We'd like to take you on a ghost tour through some of the weirdest stories the Gator Nation has to offer.

Keep reading, if you dare.

###Tower Tall Tale?

#####"The lights were all off" 

It happened in Beaty Towers East, on the third floor. Ben D. (he didn't want his last name used or to tell the story first hand) was in his room trying to get to sleep, said then-sophomore Arianne Romero, 21, Ben's friend, to whom he told the story the next day. As he lay in bed he began to hear a familiar sound: the rolling chairs moving around in the kitchen area.

“He ignored it at first and tried going back to sleep,” Romero said, her voice filled with the thrill of telling a scary story.

Then, he heard something bang loudly against his door. Annoyed, he got out of bed and barged into the kitchen area, thinking it was his roommates messing around.

No one was in the room, and the lights were all off.

Ben checked the bathroom to make sure his roommates hadn’t ducked in there to hide. Nothing. Figuring they’d run back into their own rooms, he flung open their door.

Only one roommate was home, and he was sound asleep. When Ben woke him up, he had no idea what was going on.

And that was only the first time, Romero said. Another night, Ben was trying to fall asleep when he heard the sound again – chairs moving in the common room. No one was home.

He ignored it until he saw his doorknob turn, slowly.

“He didn’t go to sleep that night,” Romero said.


#####A Little History

Jutting ungracefully out of the corner of 13th Street and Museum Road, Beaty Towers is a campus landmark and, to some, an eyesore. The coed dorm was somewhat eerily known as the “Twin Towers” when it opened in 1967 but was eventually named after professor Robert Calder Beaty (http://www.uff.ufl.edu/Facilities/Facilities.asp?ID=104). Beaty was a World War I veteran and former University of Florida Dean of Student Personnel who retired in 1960.

The UF Housing history book (http://www.housing.ufl.edu/media/about/aboutus.historybookpdf.pdf) calls Beaty Towers an “architectural anomaly” on campus, because high-rise residential facilities were nonexistent at UF and scarce throughout the southeast in general. Each of the 200 apartments in Beaty typically house four students, with two bedrooms, one bathroom and a common living area and kitchenette. 

The dorm opened in the midst of social change on college campuses, the book explains. 1967 said goodbye to dress codes and curfews for female students, and by the following summer, UF residential hall associations were no longer divided by gender.

Supposedly around that time, a girl jumped from her Beaty dormitory to her death.

As a freshman, my then-boyfriend lived in Beaty East, and I was practically the fifth roommate. I'd heard about the suicide rumor, but I didn't think much about it. I never saw anything or heard noises that couldn't be explained away, even the night after we watched "Paranormal Activity III." 

Looking back two years ago, I try to remember if my ex and I even talked about the rumor. We probably mentioned it at some point, but it doesn't stand out in my memory. Though if I had heard Romero's story, I might have thought twice about camping out there. 


#####A suicide legend

People have died on the UF campus. Death is an inevitability among 50,000 students. Some of them have died in their dorm rooms, some in Beaty Towers. A simple Google search of “UF student died Beaty Towers” turns up old Gainesville Sun articles with details. One of the first to come up is a November 1987 write-up of the alcohol poisoning death of 18-year-old freshman Robert Stevenson, who was found in his dorm room at Beaty Towers East (http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19871126&id=Hj9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D-oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3704,3048058).

Deaths like his are the ones few remember; the ones few people seem to talk about. For whatever reason, it is a death that nobody can prove actually happened that UF students hear about over and over.

From what I gather, it’s a Gator household story that a female student committed suicide by jumping from her Beaty dormitory. Which tower was it? Which room did she jump from? What year did it happen? Nobody seems to be able to answer these questions, though they keep coming up. I even remember hearing the girl was pregnant when she jumped.

According to the people who should know, however, there is no record of a girl killing herself by jumping from Beaty. I contacted the one man who might know if anyone does: Carl Van Ness, curator for manuscripts and archives at the UF libraries.

#####An “American Girl?"

The suicide legend stems from the Tom Petty song “American Girl,” Van Ness said. A popular interpretation of the song is a girl contemplating suicide. The connection to the University of Florida and, specifically, Beaty Towers, comes from the second stanza:

*Well, it was kind of cold that night,*                                                                              
*She stood alone on her balcony*                                                                                     
*Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,*                                                                             
*Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach.*                                                                       
*And for one desperate moment*                                                                                       
*There he crept back in her memory*                                                                                  
*God, it’s so painful when something that’s so close*                                                                
*Is still so far out of reach.*    

U.S. Highway 441 is actually 13th Street in Gainesville, which runs right past Beaty Towers.

Tom Petty is a Gainesville native and would have seen the dorm many times.

“Speculation has always focused on Beaty Towers as it was the only building tall enough at the time,” Van Ness said.

However, he said he has never seen any records to indicate the song is based on an actual event. Also, anyone can look up at Beaty Towers and see that no balconies exist.

“How a ghost appears is another question,” he said. “Apparently, it is the ghost of someone who never existed.”

UF spokesman Steve Orlando echoes Van Ness in his claim that nobody has committed suicide by jumping from Beaty Towers, according to an August 2009 article from The Independent Florida Alligator (http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_28668d1f-4473-57b1-9d52-ddce62158263.html). Orlando said he has met Tom Petty in person and that the singer said the rumors were completely false.

Through repeated denials, the Tom-Petty-Beaty-Towers-suicide legend stubbornly lives on. Even the Wikipedia page for “American Girl” has a section devoted to the rumor. Whenever I hear that Tom Petty song, the looming shape of Beaty inevitably comes to mind.

I asked current Beaty resident Wallis O'Hagan, 20, what she thought of the whole business. Surprisingly, neither she nor her roommate had ever heard of it -- or seen any evidence that their dorm was haunted.

"This is honestly the first I'm hearing about this," she said.

I realized I'd just helped the legend live on.


###A Night in Norman


James W. Norman Hall houses the University of Florida’s College of Education. Named for the man who was the college’s dean from 1920 to 1941 in 1958, the building itself opened in 1934 as P.K. Yonge Laboratory School. Rumors abound that an incident during that time has left Norman Hall haunted ever since.

“The legend is that, one day, three students got on the elevator when they weren’t supposed to,” says Larry Lansford, director of news and communications for the College of Education, explaining that the old-style elevator was for faculty and staff only. “It went wrong, fell from the top to the bottom floor, and they were killed in it. So the legend is those three children are the ghosts of Norman Hall.”

He hands me a copy of an article he wrote about the legend for the summer 2005 edition of “Education Times.” He emphasizes no written record has confirmed the validity of the legend, but he also concedes many strange stories have been reported around Norman Hall.

A campus police officer quit his job after he found a room with a perfectly made bed during an inspection. Upon his return in the morning, the bed had its sheets tossed about — despite the door remaining locked. Two female students both reported feeling a presence in the first-floor unisex bathroom that brought them near tears. And people repeatedly claim to hear strange sounds and feel unusual presences on the third floor, especially by the water fountain. 

“I’ve never experienced any of it,” Lansford says. “I keep an open mind, but until I experience it, I’ll believe it when I see it.”

ON A MISSION 
I volunteered to visit Norman Hall. Although some people might shy away from haunted places, we journalists are curious people, so naturally, we purposely go and hope to find some ghosts. My mission is to see if I experience similar phenomena as the people who report paranormal experiences. 

I arrive at Norman around 6:30 p.m. Tom Dana, associate dean of the College of Education, told me UFPD arrives around 10 p.m. to lock the doors. I plan to leave around 9:30 p.m. to avoid any unnecessary run-ins with police. It’s already getting dark as I enter the building. 

I walk up the stairs to the third floor. The lights are all on in the hallways, but I don’t see any other people. A palpably creepy feeling is in the staircase, but it may just be from lack of clean air; the staircase has a very mildewy smell. 

As I walk over to the water fountain, its cooling compressor shuts off, leaving the room suddenly quiet. Not exactly a good omen, I think to myself.

I put down my backpack and my umbrella and slouch against the wall next to the fountain. It’s now 6:45 p.m., and the sky outside is dark. The hallway is still deserted. I take a couple deep breaths and close my eyes.

GHOSTLY GUIDANCE 
“Which way means yes?” The pendulum swings up and down.

“Which way means no?” It swings left and right.

 “I don’t know?” It starts swinging in a circle.

It’s about three weeks earlier, and I’m sitting in the office of Dr. Andrew Nichols, a famous parapsychologist. In my hand, a pendulum is swinging different ways depending on the questions I ask it. It gets each one right.

Nichols tells me how when he was a child, he could see the auras around different life forms. After seeing a vision of his recently deceased sister, he started studying to become a parapsychologist. Now he has been the president of the American Institute of Parapsychology for 20 years. 

Nichols believes that every human being is capable of extra-sensory perception and therefore capable of experiencing paranormal occurrences. Some are naturally better at it than others. He compares the innate ability to an IQ, calling it a “Psi-Q.” 

As I mess around with his pendulum, he gives me advice on how to best perceive the energy in a haunted place.

“Get into a relaxed and receptive state of mind,” he says. The best states of mind are when one is daydreaming and on the verge of sleep.  “And you must learn to suspend critical judgment while you’re doing it. Once you start second guessing yourself, it’ll stop.” 

He also recommends sitting in dim lighting and going to the place where haunting is reported the most. Nichols says magnetic field imbalances around certain places may enhance the perceptive abilities of humans.

**7:00 p.m.** 
The water fountain cooler kicks on with a snap and nearly gives me a heart attack. I had been close to dozing off. I am still very alone. The only indication that other people might be in the building are faint sounds to my right that sound like an elevator. To my left, as I had first started to drift off, I had heard a sound like a rattling of a small chain. I’m not sure what that could have been. Other than those sounds and the low hum of the air conditioner, it is still very quiet. I scribble down some notes on a sheet of paper and then close my eyes once again. 
*** 
I have a mixed background in the paranormal. My parents and my father’s side of the family are exclusively scientists. My mother’s side of the family is descended from Gypsies, visits mediums on a regular basis and explores the mysticism of various cultures. I am also a devout Christian, so I have lots of conflicting influences when it comes to seeing ghosts.

The truth is, I want to believe. Even though every scientific bone in my body is screaming fraud, the concepts of spirits and psychic powers is too alluring for me to pass up. I believe that God exists — why not spirits as well?

So when Karen Owens, office manager of the English Language Institute, which happens to be located on the third floor of Norman Hall, tells me her family has a long history with the paranormal, I believe what she tells me.

“Someone that I know,” she says, “they’ve seen a little girl, down at the other end of the hall, when the old elevator still worked.” 

“When they go to the water fountain, they can feel it, they can feel the presence. They won’t go anywhere near the elevator to this day, and they’re an adult now.” 

Claiming to have seen a full human ghost is tough to explain as something else. Although sounds and presences can be blamed on the wind and emotions, reports of visions tend to be passed off as lies because the only other “scientific” explanation is hallucination.  

But Daryl Bish, admissions coordinator for the institute, recalls a separate instance, where a teacher quit after swearing to have seen a little girl in the same hall. He doesn’t believe it though.

“It’s just a fun story,” he says of the haunting rumors. “I’ve been here at 1 a.m. It is creepier, no doubt.”

Owens, however, believes the stories. “Other people might say I’m crazy, but we’ve had things happen in our family, so I don’t doubt it at all.”

*** 
**7:15 p.m.** – A girl’s voice.

It was soft and mumbled and really high-pitched, but I definitely heard a girl’s voice. It wasn’t in the hall either; it definitely sounded like it was being spoken into my mind.

Now I’m wide awake and not sure if I could have been dreaming. I was definitely a little spaced out, but I think I was still somewhat lucid. I definitely heard someone talking, and it was not like hearing someone from far away or from down the hall. It was like another voice just started speaking in my thoughts. 

I try to relax and slip back into my necessary state of mind, but I can’t stop thinking about the voice. For the first time tonight, I can hear my heart beating.
***
**7:30 p.m.** – There is a popular saying that “time flies when you’re having fun.” I am realizing the opposite is true as well: when you are doing nothing, time crawls at a sickeningly slow pace. Every little sound is magnified in the midst of the silence. I have heard the elevator-like noises coming from my right, as well as some creaks and moans from both sides of me. The water fountain’s cooler never fails to startle me. 

Getting a little tired of sitting and waiting, I decide to explore some other areas of the building. I walk around the hall to find the elevator. When the doors open, a loud bell dings. I would have definitely heard that from where I was sitting,so what I was hearing wasn’t the elevator. 

The doors open, and I step out on the first floor. Norman Hall is starting to make me paranoid. My heart skips a beat every time I open a door or turn a corner. So far I haven’t encountered anything or anyone else. That changes quickly as I hear a cough. 

I follow the sound of coughing to a break room with vending machines. At the other end of the room sits a man working on a laptop. I decide to approach him and tell him about my mission. He says I’m the only other person he’s seen in the last few hours. 

I ask him when UFPD locks the doors, and he tells me they usually come at 11 p.m. He says he studies here often and he’s sometimes managed to stay until 1 a.m. without a problem. 

The prospect of an overnight stay is enticing, but Norman Hall is wearing on me. Every minute staying by that water fountain gets harder and harder. Walking the halls is unsettling. The stairs feel claustrophobic. I decide not to stay any longer than I originally planned. 

I pay the unisex bathroom on the first floor a visit. The two girls Lansford described were shaken to tears by this bathroom. I expect to feel the same creepiness I did by the water fountain, but it’s actually a fairly comforting place. It’s a large, bright bathroom with plenty of space and working amenities. If it is haunted, I don’t feel it.

Eventually I make my way back up to the third floor by route of the stairs at the other end of the building. By the time I sit down again, it is 7:45 p.m. Looking around, I remember Dr. Nichols advised me to be in dimly lit settings. The lights in the hallways are all still glowing bright.

I walk over to my left and flick one switch. The hallway to my left goes dark. There is still a bright light at the end of it, so I walk down and flick that light off too. I go to the right of the water fountain and turn out the light above that hallway.

Only the light in the center room remains on. After some searching, I go out to the stairwell and find that switch as well.

Now it is very dark. And I as I sit back down, I actually feel consciously afraid.
***
**8:00 p.m.** – I’m jarred out of my reverie by noises from the stairwell. They were definitely coming from people. Not wanting to make an awkward scene by having people wander in on a dark hallway with a man sitting on the floor, I quickly jump up and start turning on the lights. 

I turn on the main light, the right hallway light, the left hallway light, and the light at the end of the hallway — revealing a box.

I stop and look down the hall. There is a small, brown, open box just sitting in the middle of the hallway. I walked down that hallway about 15 minutes earlier. I may not be the most observant person in the world, but I would have noticed a box in the middle of my walking path. 

I walk down the hall and look inside. It’s empty. The information on the side indicates it was for the person in the nearest office.

I go back to my spot and turn the lights back off. The people never came to the third floor. My mind is racing. *Did I really not notice that box? If it wasn’t there, how did it get there? It’s so quiet around here, I would have heard footsteps.*

I recall what Nichols told me. 
“Be an open-minded skeptic,” he said. “Make your own judgment, but give yourself a chance to have a connection with the unknown. These experiences can be transformative.”
***
**8:15 p.m.** – My eyes have finally adjusted to the dark. I can now discern shadows from what previously looked like movement. I still hear the elevator-like noises. Once again, I hear sounds coming from the stairwell. I decide I should take another trip through the building.

I descend to the first floor and return to the break room. The man with the laptop is still there, and he nods at me as I sit to jot down notes. After I finish, I walk over to talk to him.

He reveals himself to be Tyler Egan, an undergraduate botany student with aspirations of medical school. He says he works down the street from Norman, so it makes a good study location. Because he is often here late into the night, I ask him what he knows about the building.

Despite coming here for years, he is unaware of the haunted rumors. He says he knows about how old this building is, and he has always been drawn to that. Even though he often stays late, he has never had any paranormal experiences.

“Then again, I only ever come to the first floor,” he says. I observe the well-lit, spacious break room has an entirely different feel than the third-floor water fountain. 

“All I ever see are rats and mice that run around here,” he says.

You see rats and mice?

“Yeah, they come out of that corner,” he says, gesturing to a spot. “I haven’t seen them in the last few weeks though.”

He then tells me the first-floor men’s bathroom used to have a thin piece of metal loosely attached to the wall and pulling it back would reveal a small staircase going down. “Although I don’t know what down from here would be,” he says. “We’re on the ground.”

I go to the bathroom to confirm this. The thin metal he referred to has since been replaced by a much sturdier metal plate, with screws in it that are strong enough to fix it on but loose enough to see there is definitely a lot of space behind it. The screws are big enough that I could probably unscrew them with my keys, but that would probably be illegal to do, so I don’t. 

**8:45 p.m.** – Readjusting my eyes to the darkness is a pain, but I’m soon back in business in my spot by the water fountain. It’s much harder now. It’s not that I feel tired, but I feel almost heavier. When I sit next to the water fountain, I feel like I constantly want to leave. I’m never comfortable.

A long time passes with nothing happening. Just as soon as I start to think it might be all in my head, the two hallways on either side of me dim. Then I hear a pop in the right hallway, followed immediately by the chain rattle from the left, followed by the crack of the water fountain cooler turning on. I think the universe is trying to teach me a lesson.

After 30 tense minutes, I decide to spend my final 15 minutes in Norman at another location.



**9:15 p.m.** – It would look like just a normal brown, wooden door, if not for the big, red sign that reads, “ELEVATOR OUT OF SERVICE.” Just a couple of paces away is the new elevator; sleek, shiny and metallic.  I turn as many lights off as I can and sit down next to the old elevator.  

In his article, Lansford writes about how the elevator where the children supposedly died was an old-style elevator, with a spring-loaded accordion-style gate. At the time of the article, 2005, students still had to use that elevator. 

I keep waiting for the impending dread — but it doesn’t come. The hallway feels like any other normal hallway. This is actually the most normal I have felt all night. 

It gets to be 9:30, and so I end my mission on a confusing note. I leave the third floor, turning back on all of the lights as I go. As I step out into the night air, the weighty feeling doesn’t leave. I make it all the way back to my house before I feel any different.

I’m left to wonder about my experience — no ghosts, no visions and no definitive signs of paranormal activity. I did always feel worse by the water fountain than anywhere else in the building. But it’s difficult to separate how much of that was actual paranormal activity, how much was my knowledge of its haunting and how much my fear of getting in trouble — even though I wasn’t breaking any laws of which I am aware.

Talking with Egan also made me wonder. He didn’t know about the hauntings, and he never had any paranormal problems. In fact, maybe Norman seems haunted because, as he pointed out, it is an old building. It creaks, moans, has stale air and even has rats from time to time. All of those things could explain lots of paranormal phenomena.

Still, there was that girl’s voice. And there was that mysterious box. 

So is it possible that Norman Hall is truly haunted? Even though Lansford doesn’t believe it is, if there were ghosts, he wouldn't care much. 

“I like working here," he says. "I figure they haven’t harmed anyone if they are here, so, you know, we can cohabitate together if they’re there." 

Owens feels similarly. 
“It doesn’t bother me," he says. "And I stay here after people have left.”

If Norman Hall is haunted, then staying around the paranormal energy could be beneficial. Nichols says the best way to learn about parapsychology is to go out and try it. And it is the trained parapsychologist’s duty to provide a road map.

“What parapsychologists can do is help people experience these things for themselves," he says, "so they can make their own judgments.”

Nichols does say that more individual scientists — if not science as a whole — are coming around to seeing his field as legitimate. 

“These experiences are an important part of the human experience,” he says. “And no attempt to understand the human mind would be complete without considering these experiences.”

###Paranormal Problem Solvers

I was curious, curious about who these people were and skeptical about what they did. 

I walked into the Engineering Building on the UF campus at 7:50 p.m., looking for the white polo shirts he said they’d be wearing. On their website they claimed to be “everyday people,” passionate and interested in researching and investigating paranormal activity.  

Pete Bolejack, the founder of Florida Paranormal Investigations (FPI), and Stephanie Boothby, a doctoral student in anthropology at UF and member of the non-profit organization, shook my hand kindly. 	

They were more professional and gentler-looking than I had imagined. I felt silly for carrying my pepper spray along with me, thinking that I’d have to protect myself from something paranormal that might have tagged along for the interview.    

“ 'I’ve never told anyone this before because I didn’t think anyone would believe me; they’d think I was crazy.’ I hear that one line; I’ve heard it dozens of times,” Boothby said. 

Alongside the rest of their team, Boothby and Bolejack investigate all things bizarre: the noises, the sightings, the smells and sensations. Together they attempt to explain the unexplainable. “It’s about helping people, helping them not to be afraid in their own homes, giving them ways to deal with what’s going on,” Boothby said. 

Humbled perfectly describes what I felt. Boothby and Bolejack weren’t typical ghost hunters.  They weren’t seeking a high or a thrill but wanted to help people experiencing the abnormal, the paranormal, though I still wasn't quite sure what that actually meant.

“Paranormal activity is activity created by unknown forces that we do not understand,” Bolejack explained. 

According to Boothby, there can be many different interpretations of who or what these “unknown forces” are and what sort of activity is actually occurring. For example, unlike parapsychologists who believe that paranormal activity is mostly caused by the energy of living people, as paranormal researchers, Boothby said they believe that the deceased cause paranormal activity. This affects how FPI approaches situations with clients and paranormal activity in general.  

“A lot of experiences range from spiritual to more paranormal to something just strange and unnatural,” Boothby said. 

According to FPI, people experience paranormal activity on different levels and in different ways, including audibly, visually and sensationally. People claim to hear footsteps, rustling, conversations or voices saying their name when no one else is around. They might see apparitions (a ghostlike image of a person), or they might feel static sensations or sense that someone is watching them. According to Boothby, audible experiences seem to be the most common. 

How frightening, I thought, to be bombarded with noises and suspicions and the question of: “Am I crazy?” I couldn’t recall ever experiencing something as I’ve described above, something paranormal I suppose, but I began to feel an inevitable hopelessness for the people who did. 

The two questions Bolejack and Boothby said they answer the most are: “Am I crazy?” and “Is my house haunted?” 

“People are questioning their sanity, and that’s an extreme state to be in when you’re questioning whether you’re crazy or not,” Boothby said. 
 
The FPI team tells clients, “We’re here to listen. We’re not going to judge you. We’ve heard it all, and we’re going to help you determine what’s paranormal. We’re here to help you find a solution.” 

And that’s just what they do; find solutions. 

According to their website, when clients call Florida Paranormal Investigations, they are asked a series of about 80 questions, including questions regarding the home they are living in, information about the people living in the home and details of the weird experiences they’ve had.  

After doing a baseline test, the FPI team plans an investigation. At night, they arrive to the home assumed to have bizarre activity with equipment such as cameras, audio recorders, K2 meters and laptops. From anywhere between three to six hours, FPI pays close attention to the environment of the home, documenting any sights, sounds, smells or sensations that might hint at paranormal activity.  

According to Bolejack, they do not ask clients to leave their homes during investigations but prefer for them to stay in a particular area of the house for the duration of the investigation and to stay as quiet as possible. 

Unless the FPI wants to use the clients’ pets as tools in the investigation, then they, too, are asked to remain in a confined area of the house. But Bolejack said that they often do like to use clients’ pets. "They are more sensitive to paranormal activity than we are as individuals,” Bolejack said. “They also can’t lie, and they can’t make things up, which makes them a great asset,” he chuckled. 

For example, if a dog has been claimed to bark at a corner of the house at the same time every night, that’s an indication that something bizarre is going on. This doesn’t necessarily confirm that something paranormal is going on, but the dog’s tendency causes the FPI team to be more curious about that specific corner and the activity that might be going on there, Bolejack said.  

The same applies to children, as well. Bolejack said that children often play an important role while investigating, because unfortunately whatever oddities are occurring usually involve them. According to Bolejack, when children become so bothered by something and the parents feel helpless, they call FPI.

“ 'Are you gonna make the ghosts go away?' ” children often ask. “You look at them and you’re like, what do I say to that?” Bolejack shrugged. 
	
FPI said that they don’t necessarily make the ghosts go away, but they do either diagnose the home of possessing paranormal activity or debunk the home of paranormal activity. From there they point the client in the right direction. 

I asked Boothby to repeat this word, debunk. It sounded like something from a Halloween cartoon movie. I wrote the word down. I was beginning to understand who Bolejack and Boothby were: knowledgeable researchers of paranormal activity and compassionate people hoping to fight paranormal crime in others’ lives, but I still couldn’t grasp it all. I sat at the table, a seat next to Boothby and a seat across from Bolejack, wondering if it were for some greater purpose that I’d met them, talking with them about something I knew so little about. I looked back down at the word written in my notebook: debunk. 

According to FPI, when they enter into an investigation, they do so with the hope that they will be able to find alternative answers to the odd activity that is occurring there. This is called debunking.

For example, according to Bolojack, electrical appliances produce man-made electromagnetic fields. FPI refers to what is being produced as “EMF.” When the EMF is too strong in a certain location, for instance if an appliance is producing a strong amount of EMF, a person might experience strange symptoms from that EMF, such as paranoia. A symptom like paranoia is similar to what someone might feel if they are experiencing something paranormal. After measuring the strength of EMF with a device called a K2 meter, FPI claims the ability to distinguish whether such a symptom is due to paranormal activity or to strong EMF. If they can conclude that the paranoia is due to strong EMF then they’ve debunked the situation of paranormal activity.

The FPI can also debunk claims of paranormal activity by proving that the scratching they are hearing is a tree limb on a window, or that the strange noises are really just coming from the expanding and contracting of old metal water pipes. These sorts of conclusions comfort clients, but FPI can’t always debunk a claim. The paranoia can’t always be fixed by an electrician or by installing new water pipes.

After carefully sifting through and analyzing their findings from an investigation, FPI decides what they can and cannot prove, what they can and cannot debunk. “You kind of narrow it down and be like, OK, only these claims left are the ones we can’t explain,” Boothby said.
 	 
FPI said that it is their goal is to provide clients with tangible evidence, evidence proving that something can be debunked or evidence proving that there is in fact abnormal, unexplainable activity occurring. They use things such as their video and audio recordings and personal experiences of being in the home as evidence. If they have reason to believe that paranormal activity is present, they offer clients the service of having their home “cleansed” of any activity. The FPI team doesn’t do this themselves but provides clients with references who can.  

After an investigation, FPI said that they keep in contact with their clients, answering further questions and ensuring further peace of mind. 

Bolejack reminds clients that not all paranormal activity is evil or harmful, but the stress and fear that clients undergo can be detrimental to their mental, emotional and physical health. This encompasses not only the fear that they may be experiencing something paranormal, but also the fear to tell others about what they are experiencing. 

“When we go to people and they say 'I’ve never told anyone about this,’ it’s this gush of relief that they have and instantly, even without doing the investigation, we’ve helped them physiologically, just being able to let them open up and share what they’ve experienced,” Boothby said. “I think if people were more open about hearing about paranormal experiences without being judgmental, I think a lot more people would be helped right off the bat.” 

I couldn't stop thinking about what Boothby had just said. It's like she was talking to me. Had I been judgmental before? Would I be willing to listen to someone experiencing something that I couldn't understand and struggled to even believe? I couldn’t shake these questions. I realized that I hadn’t remained completely objective in my time with with Boothby and Bolejack but had been impacted. 

An hour and a half had gone by. I had more t’s to cross and i’s to dot, but I was too consumed in who Boothby and Bolejack were as people and what good they did for others with problems I had no idea about. 

All else that I learned from the FPI team that night were only details that filled the holes in the story I wanted to tell. 

They said they were part of a network of paranormal investigation teams in Florida and around the nation. At a moment’s notice FPI can call upon their sister team in St. Augustine for help. They receive calls weekly from people inquiring about paranormal activity. Naturally the month of October is their busiest month. They pursue private investigations within a two-hour radius of Gainesville and will refer investigations outside of this radius to other teams. 

FPI said that they don't do many private investigations in Gainesville, though. They think this is because many people don't consider Gainesville to be a haunted city, thus people aren’t quick to assume that something strange is automatically something paranormal.

FPI believes that ghost stories linger when generations of people live in a city. Because UF replenishes Gainesville with a new population every year, the ghost stories just don’t stick. 

But FPI isn't in this to chase the hype, glam and glitz of ghost stories; they're in it to chase truth and the people that the truth affects.

“It’s no longer a kid story. It’s no longer fables and myths,” Bolejack said. “It’s more and more people coming to terms with ‘there is something out there; we may not understand it, but there is something out there.’ More and more people are coming out to acknowledge that.”   

And for the first time, I, too, was beginning to acknowledge this. 


###Real...or Unreal?

We've come to the end of our tour. Some of us saw ghosts, some of us simply experienced the quiet of old buildings and the sensations of history. We've talked to students like us who have seen, heard and felt things they could not understand. We've talked to professionals who may know more about the supernatural than we ever will. We even tried our hand at ghost hunting, emerging from the corridors of Norman Hall without proof that ghosts exist -- but still unable to say with certainty that they don't. 

Maybe hauntings happen, maybe they are simply dripping faucets that can be explained away. Maybe people who believe in ghosts see ghosts. Maybe we're not meant to know for sure. 

Even if the University of Florida isn't haunted by unfortunate school children or suicidal American girls, the rumors live on like restless spirits. It's part of the culture that colors the school and adds character to the experience of four years here. We'll keep our ghost stories, true or not -- just because they belong to us.  

So next time you find yourself the only one in your Beaty Towers dorm or walking down an empty Norman hallway, remember you might not actually be alone.
