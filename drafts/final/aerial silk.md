Aerialists enthuse UF campus with circus art

She spends a lot of time hanging, but in a different way than most students.

Jana Rosenbloom, UF master of landscape architecture student, spends her downtime graciously climbing, spinning and dropping from a silk curtain in a large tree on campus.

An art form that is considered part of circus arts, aerial silk portrays the beauty of silk wrapping around the body, allowing it to create a sense of elevated modern dance.

It’s not only a skill that requires strength, power, flexibility and bravery, but it’s also a talent that can only be mastered with practice and patience. 

Those passing by can find Rosenbloom, 24, on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons practicing in a tree next to the Broward Outdoor Recreation Center.

“This is our tree at the moment, unless we find a better climbing tree somewhere,” she said. “We like it here because it’s relatively quiet, but we still have people walk by who come and talk to us and see what we’re doing, which is fun.”

Rosenbloom did gymnastics for two years when she was younger, mainly practicing in her backyard by herself. Little did she know the strength and flexibility would help her with a talent she would pursue later in life.

When she was working toward getting her undergraduate degree in sustainability and the built environment, her constant escape from endless hours working in the design studio was practicing and improving as an aerialist.

It all started about three years ago when she walked by and saw a UF club practicing aerial silk in the window and decided to try it herself.

“As soon as I came home the first day, I knew this was something I was going to be doing for years,” she said, “I knew I wanted to keep going with it.”

It took her about a year to become comfortable working with the silk on her own and doing drops without a spotter. “I was a little bit frustrated because it took time,” she said. “It takes everyone time to learn how to climb and do the basic moves, but I knew that I wanted to stick with it.”

Corey Souza, owner and artistic director at S-Connection Aerial Arts, said the best way to physically prepare for practicing aerial silk is to take an aerial conditioning class.

“There’s so much preparation work and just basic core strengthening that needs to be done before you can start getting up in the air,” she said.

Push-ups, pull-ups, planks and leg lifts are ideal exercises for basic conditioning, and it’s important for artists to think about improving their posture.

“If you don’t do them right on the ground, when you get in the air, it’s just going to be a disaster,” she said. “If you can do the conditioning class with good form and good technique, then you can do anything.” 

For Rosenbloom, the most challenging thing about doing aerial silk at first was core strength, and she had to work on strengthening her abs to be able to do certain movements on the silk.

“I play out my strengths such as flexibility and focus on those on my pieces,” she said.

Rosenbloom recruited one of her classmates, Joseph Craig Lackey, a fourth-year UF landscape architecture student from Palm Beach Gardens, to practice with her.

“My intentions are to become good and develop multiple skill sets,” Lackey said, “and I would be content just staying on the silk for more than three minutes.”

With the help and interest of Lackey, Rosenbloom was able to start pursuing partner work, and she said she appreciates Lackey being her base.

Souza said that when it comes to partner work, performers need to make sure they are in tune and fully connected with each other so that they move together.

“They have to breathe together and be so in synch that they can read each other’s minds,” she said.

Maintaining endurance is the most challenging obstacle for aerial performers, Souza said, and the first step for aspiring performers is to get used to discomfort and pain.

Lackey said learning how to perform on the silk has been a challenge, and as soon as one thing stops hurting, something else hurts. 

“Even the more experienced people, I’ve been noticing, the more bruises you have, the more advanced you are,” he said.

But professionals like Souza don’t intimidate the pair of aspiring artists—they inspire them. 

Rosenbloom and Lackey said they have noticed that the circus community is extremely encouraging and welcoming to new people who want to try the skills. 

“No one ever looks down on anyone because they can’t do something,” Lackey said. “We all just want to help each other get better. If you’re an outsider and you’re coming in, it’s that welcoming feeling that you’re being invited.”

They said they love teaching the basic climb to people passing by who see the silk and express interest.

“It’s nice to explain it to someone else, because then it solidifies it to you and you understand it better,” Rosenbloom said.

She said when people first watch her, they think it takes mostly upper body strength to pull their bodies up and are surprised to find out that it takes mostly leg strength to make their way up the silk. “It does take some arm strength, but not to the extent that it looks like,” she said.

Souza compares aerial silk to any other form of dance, stressing that core strength is essential, and dancers usually work and develop from the center outward. 

“You’re always shifting your weight between your legs and your arms, but you really have to have that connection to your deep abdominal muscles,” she said.

Dancing on silk can be very dangerous, and Souza recommends that beginners or people who want to try aerial silk for the first time should seek real instruction instead of trying to learn it themselves. 

The best advice she has for beginners is to have patience with their bodies and more importantly, take care of their bodies.

“You will get used to it. You’ll have blisters. You’re going to lose skin off your arms and the back of your legs,” Souza said. “All pain is temporary if you can achieve really really amazing things.”
