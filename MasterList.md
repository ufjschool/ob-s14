This is the central list for the editors and designers to know exactly what content will be in the magazine. Because github just lists everything in terms of file names, it is important that we have a breakdown of who wrote what, where each story fits, and what is associated with each story. If you don't see your story or piece on this list, make sure to add it in the appropriate section.
